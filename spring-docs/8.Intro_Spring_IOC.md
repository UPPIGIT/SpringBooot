# Understanding Spring IOC Container

In this lecture, we delve into the core concepts of the Spring Inversion of Control (IoC) container, a pivotal component within the Spring Core framework. The Spring IoC container plays a crucial role in managing the creation, configuration, and lifecycle of beans, the building blocks of a Spring application.

## Key Concepts:

1. **Role of Spring IOC Container:**
   - The Spring IOC container oversees the creation and configuration of beans, managing their lifecycles and handling dependencies between them.
   - It controls events such as bean creation and destruction, providing effective management for Java objects.

2. **Types of IOC Containers:**
   - Spring IOC container is implemented through two main interfaces: `BeanFactory` and `ApplicationContext`.
   - `BeanFactory` is a basic IOC container that handles fundamental tasks like bean creation and dependency injection.
   - `ApplicationContext`, an advanced IOC container, extends `BeanFactory` and offers additional features like event handling, internalization, and messaging.

3. **Choosing Between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext:**
   - For basic Spring applications without requiring advanced features, `BeanFactory` is suitable.
   - `ApplicationContext` is recommended for enterprise applications, providing enhanced capabilities beyond basic bean management.

4. **Dependency Injection (DI) Pattern:**
   - The Spring IOC container employs the Dependency Injection pattern to dynamically inject dependencies between multiple objects.
   - Dependencies are injected based on configurations provided during runtime, fostering loose coupling within the application.

5. **Context Information:**
   - `Context` serves as a virtual memory location within Spring, storing information about bean configurations, dependencies, and initial values.
   - During application startup, the Spring IOC container looks for context information to instantiate and configure beans.

6. **Configuration Instructions:**
   - Developers provide configurations through XML or annotations, specifying which classes should be converted into beans, their dependencies, and other initialization details.
   - Spring IOC container uses these instructions to prepare a fully configured application.

## Practical Overview:

- **Basic Flow:**
  - Spring IOC container leverages core libraries, principles of Inversion of Control, and Dependency Injection.
  - It utilizes context, a memory location storing configuration details.
  - During application startup, the container converts Java objects into beans based on context information.

- **Dependency Injection in Action:**
  - Spring IOC container, using Spring Expression Language (SpEL), dynamically injects dependencies between beans.

## Code Examples:

1. **Using Annotations for Configuration:**
   ```java
   @Component
   public class Vehicle {
       // Class implementation
   }

   @Configuration
   @ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example")
   public class AppConfig {
       // Configuration details
   }
   ```

2. **ApplicationContext Usage:**
   ```java
   // Creating ApplicationContext using annotation configuration
   ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);

   // Getting a bean from the context
   Vehicle vehicle = context.getBean(Vehicle.class);
   ```

3. **Dependency Injection with SpEL:**
   ```java
   @Component
   public class Person {
       @Value("#{systemProperties['user.name']}")
       private String username;

       // Getter and Setter methods
   }
   ```

## Conclusion:

Understanding the Spring IOC container is fundamental for effective Spring application development.
