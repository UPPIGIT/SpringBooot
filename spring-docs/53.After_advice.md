In this lecture, the implementation of `@AfterThrowing` and `@AfterReturning` advices is introduced in the LoggerAspect. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Implementing `@AfterThrowing` Advice:**
   - A new method, `logException`, is added to the `LoggerAspect` class. This method is annotated with `@AfterThrowing`.
   - The `@AfterThrowing` advice captures information about an exception thrown by the target method.

   ```java
   @AfterThrowing(pointcut = "execution(* com.example.services.*.*(..))", throwing = "ex")
   public void logException(JoinPoint joinPoint, Exception ex) {
       logger.severe("From " + joinPoint.getSignature() +
               ", an exception occurred: " + ex.getMessage());
   }
   ```

   - The method captures the exception (`ex`) and logs details such as the method signature and the exception message.

2. **Implementing `@AfterReturning` Advice:**
   - Another new method, `logStatus`, is added to the `LoggerAspect` class. This method is annotated with `@AfterReturning`.
   - The `@AfterReturning` advice captures information about the return value when the target method completes successfully.

   ```java
   @AfterReturning(pointcut = "execution(* com.example.services.*.*(..))", returning = "status")
   public void logStatus(JoinPoint joinPoint, Object status) {
       logger.info("From " + joinPoint.getSignature() +
               ", method successfully processed with the status: " + status);
   }
   ```

   - The method captures the return value (`status`) and logs details such as the method signature and the return value.

3. **Testing with Exception:**
   - In the `VehicleService` class, a `NullPointerException` is intentionally thrown in the `moveVehicle` method to test the `@AfterThrowing` advice.

   ```java
   public void moveVehicle() {
       // Business logic without unnecessary checks...
       throw new NullPointerException("Dam! null pointer exception occurred.");
   }
   ```

   - When the application is executed, it stops at the `logException` method, logging details about the exception.

4. **Testing Successful Execution:**
   - The `NullPointerException` is commented out to allow successful execution of the `moveVehicle` method.
   - When the application is executed again, it stops at the `logStatus` method, logging details about the successful execution and the return value.

   ```java
   public void moveVehicle() {
       // Business logic without unnecessary checks...
       returnTypes.rotate();
   }
   ```

   - The return value in this case is "Vehicle moving with the help of Michelin tyres."

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The use of `@AfterThrowing` and `@AfterReturning` advices allows for handling logic after exceptions and successful method executions, respectively.
   - These advices provide a way to separate cross-cutting concerns from the core business logic.

Understanding and utilizing these aspects in Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) provides a cleaner and more modular structure for handling common functionalities in an application.
