# Creating Spring Beans in a Maven Project

In the previous lecture, we set up a MAVEN project, laying the groundwork for creating and managing beans within a Java application using the Spring framework. Beans are fundamental in Spring, serving as the core building blocks for advanced features like autowiring, dependency injection, and loose coupling.

## Understanding the Basics

When we create an object using the `new` operator, it becomes a simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object). However, the Spring IOC (Inversion of Control) container or Spring context remains unaware of these objects. It is the developer's responsibility to provide sufficient information to the Spring IOC container to manage Java objects effectively.

The most basic approach to create a Spring bean is by using the `@Bean` annotation on top of a Java method. This method, annotated with `@Bean`, will return an object that Spring will convert into a managed bean.

```java
@Configuration
public class ProjectConfig {

    @Bean
    public Vehicle vehicle() {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
        vehicle.setName("Audi A8");
        return vehicle;
    }

    @Bean
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }

    @Bean
    public Integer number() {
        return 42;
    }
}
```

Here, the `vehicle()` method creates a `Vehicle` object, sets its name, and returns it. The `@Bean` annotation indicates to Spring that the returned object should be managed as a bean.

## Creating a POJO Class

Let's create a simple POJO class, `Vehicle`, to illustrate the concept:

```java
package com.example.beans;

public class Vehicle {
    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

## Initializing the Spring Context

To initialize the Spring IOC container, we need a main class that uses `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`:

```java
package com.example.main;

import com.example.beans.Vehicle;
import com.example.config.ProjectConfig;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;

public class ExampleOne {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create Spring context and provide the configuration class
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ProjectConfig.class);

        // Create a non-Spring bean
        Vehicle nonSpringVehicle = new Vehicle();
        nonSpringVehicle.setName("Honda City");
        System.out.println("Vehicle name from non-Spring context: " + nonSpringVehicle.getName());

        // Fetch and print Spring-managed beans
        Vehicle springVehicle = context.getBean(Vehicle.class);
        System.out.println("Vehicle name from Spring context: " + springVehicle.getName());

        String message = context.getBean(String.class);
        System.out.println("String from Spring context: " + message);

        Integer number = context.getBean(Integer.class);
        System.out.println("Number from Spring context: " + number);

        // Close the context
        context.close();
    }
}
```

In this example, we retrieve the beans from the Spring context using the `getBean` method. Spring takes care of managing these beans, and no explicit typecasting is required.

## Conclusion

Creating Spring beans is fundamental to utilizing advanced features within the Spring framework. In upcoming lectures, we will explore additional approaches to creating beans. The complete code for this example can be found in the [GitHub repository](link_to_repository).

Thank you for your patience, and I look forward to exploring more Spring concepts in the next lecture.

Certainly! Let's create an example with `Employee` and `Department` classes, demonstrating the relationship between the two. We'll use the `@Component` and `@Autowired` annotations for dependency injection.

### Example: Employee and Department

1. **Create the `Employee` Class:**

   ```java
   package com.example.beans;

   import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

   @Component
   public class Employee {
       private String name;
       private int employeeId;
       private Department department;

       // Constructors, getters, and setters

       // Constructor for simplicity
       public Employee(String name, int employeeId) {
           this.name = name;
           this.employeeId = employeeId;
       }

       // Print employee details
       public void displayEmployeeDetails() {
           System.out.println("Employee: " + name + ", Employee ID: " + employeeId);
           if (department != null) {
               System.out.println("Department: " + department.getName());
           } else {
               System.out.println("No department assigned yet.");
           }
       }

       // Setter for department
       public void setDepartment(Department department) {
           this.department = department;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Create the `Department` Class:**

   ```java
   package com.example.beans;

   import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

   @Component
   public class Department {
       private String name;

       // Constructors, getters, and setters

       // Constructor for simplicity
       public Department(String name) {
           this.name = name;
       }

       // Getter for name
       public String getName() {
           return name;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Update Configuration Class: `ProjectConfig`**

   ```java
   package com.example.config;

   import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;
   import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

   @Configuration
   @ComponentScan("com.example.beans")
   public class ProjectConfig {
       // Configuration class remains empty or may contain other beans created using @Bean annotation
   }
   ```

4. **Accessing Beans in Main Class:**

   ```java
   package com.example.main;

   import com.example.beans.Department;
   import com.example.beans.Employee;
   import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;

   public class ExampleThree {

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           // Create Spring context and provide the configuration class
           AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ProjectConfig.class);

           // Access the Employee and Department beans
           Employee employee = context.getBean(Employee.class);
           Department department = context.getBean(Department.class);

           // Set the department for the employee
           employee.setDepartment(department);

           // Display employee details
           employee.displayEmployeeDetails();

           // Close the context
           context.close();
       }
   }
   ```

In this example, the `Employee` and `Department` classes are marked as `@Component`, making them Spring-managed beans. The `ProjectConfig` class enables component scanning to detect these beans.

The `ExampleThree` main class demonstrates dependency injection by setting the `Department` for an `Employee` and displaying the employee details.

Make sure to adjust the package names based on your project structure.
