# Understanding the `@Primary` Annotation in Spring

In this lecture, we'll delve into the purpose and usage of the `@Primary` annotation in the Spring framework. The `@Primary` annotation is employed when you want to designate a default bean to be used in scenarios where there might be ambiguity, particularly when fetching a bean without specifying its name.

## Usage of `@Primary` Annotation

Consider the following scenario where three beans (`AudiVehicle`, `HondaVehicle`, and `FerrariVehicle`) of type `Vehicle` are defined. The `@Primary` annotation is applied to the `FerrariVehicle` bean, indicating that it should be considered the default bean when there is ambiguity.

```java
@Configuration
public class ProjectConfig {

    @Bean
    public Vehicle audiVehicle() {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
        vehicle.setName("Audi");
        return vehicle;
    }

    @Primary
    @Bean
    public Vehicle hondaVehicle() {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
        vehicle.setName("Honda");
        return vehicle;
    }

    @Primary
    @Bean
    public Vehicle ferrariVehicle() {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
        vehicle.setName("Ferrari");
        return vehicle;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `@Primary` annotation is used to specify that `FerrariVehicle` should be the default bean in case of ambiguity.

## Fetching the Default Bean

In the main class (`ExampleFour`), the `getBean` method is called without specifying the bean name. The Spring IOC container is now smart enough to identify the default bean and return it.

```java
public class ExampleFour {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ProjectConfig.class);

        Vehicle defaultVehicle = context.getBean(Vehicle.class);

        System.out.println("Default vehicle: " + defaultVehicle.getName());

        context.close();
    }
}
```

## Handling Multiple Primary Beans

If, however, you apply the `@Primary` annotation to multiple beans of the same type, it will lead to ambiguity, and the Spring IOC container will throw an exception.

```java
@Configuration
public class ProjectConfig {

    @Primary
    @Bean
    public Vehicle audiVehicle() {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
        vehicle.setName("Audi");
        return vehicle;
    }

    @Primary
    @Bean
    public Vehicle hondaVehicle() {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
        vehicle.setName("Honda");
        return vehicle;
    }

    @Primary
    @Bean
    public Vehicle ferrariVehicle() {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
        vehicle.setName("Ferrari");
        return vehicle;
    }
}
```

In this case, attempting to fetch the default bean without specifying the name will result in a `NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException`:

```
No qualifying bean of type 'Vehicle' available: expected single matching bean but found 3: audiVehicle, hondaVehicle, ferrariVehicle
```

## Conclusion

The `@Primary` annotation is a handy tool in scenarios where you want to define a default bean to be used when there is ambiguity. It is particularly useful when fetching beans without specifying the name, and it helps in gracefully handling situations where multiple beans of the same type exist. Remember to use it judiciously to avoid unintentional ambiguities in your Spring applications.
