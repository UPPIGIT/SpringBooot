# Evolution of Web Applications in the Java Ecosystem

In this lecture, let's explore the fascinating journey of web application development within the Java ecosystem over the past few decades. The evolution is marked by significant advancements, paradigm shifts, and the emergence of transformative technologies.

## Early 2000s: Complexities and Challenges

In the early 2000s, developers primarily relied on a stack comprising JSP, HTML, CSS, Servlets, JDBC for database interaction, SOAP-based Web services, and Java Enterprise Edition. However, this era lacked established web design patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller), resulting in complex and tightly coupled code. The absence of supporting frameworks made web application development intricate, with all components—presentation layer, business layer, and data/persistence layer—intertwined.

## Mid-2000s: Rise of MVC and Frameworks

The mid-2000s witnessed a pivotal shift with the introduction of design patterns like MVC. This pattern aimed to separate concerns, facilitating a clearer division between models (data and business logic), views (presentation layer), and controllers (handling user input and managing flow). Frameworks such as Spring and Struts embraced MVC, making web application development more manageable. On the database front, the cumbersome JDBC was alleviated by ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks like Hibernate. The frontend also saw simplification with JavaScript libraries like jQuery and improved CSS display through Bootstrap.

## 2010s: Monolithic Applications and Framework Success

The 2010s brought about the era of Monolithic Applications, where all the code components were deployed into a single server. Frameworks such as Spring, Struts, Hibernate, jQuery, and Bootstrap gained widespread adoption. The combination of MVC patterns and these frameworks significantly eased development, reducing unnecessary complexities associated with earlier approaches.

## 2020s: Cloud, Microservices, and Containerization

The 2020s ushered in a new wave of advancements, emphasizing cloud computing, microservices architecture, Docker, Kubernetes, and enhanced frameworks. Developers now have the flexibility to build UI applications using separate frameworks like Angular or React. On the backend, modern frameworks such as Spring Boot, microservices architecture, and tools like Docker and Spring Data JPA have streamlined development processes. These technologies contribute to making web application development more modular, scalable, and adaptable to evolving industry needs.
