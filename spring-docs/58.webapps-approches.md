# Types of Web Applications with Spring Framework

In this lecture, let's delve into the different types of web applications that can be built using the Spring framework. Spring has played a pivotal role in simplifying web application development, offering flexibility and scalability. Two main approaches or types of web applications stand out:

## Approach 1: Full-Stack Web Applications

In this approach, both the frontend and backend components are encapsulated within a single web application. This type of application handles the UI code, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the backend logic and persistence. The responsibilities encompass processing requests, storing data, and preparing views based on client requests.

### Key Components:
1. **Spring Core:** The fundamental library providing core functionalities for all Spring projects.
2. **Spring MVC (Model View Controller):** Facilitates the implementation of the MVC pattern, allowing the separation of model, view, and controller for loose coupling.
3. **Spring Boot:** Simplifies the development of Spring applications, providing convention over configuration.
4. **Spring Data:** Handles the persistence layer, offering abstractions for data access.
5. **Spring REST:** Enables the building of RESTful services for communication between different components.
6. **Spring Security:** Implements security features within the web application.

This approach is suitable for applications where frontend and backend tightly integrate, and all functionalities are encapsulated within a single deployment unit.

## Approach 2: Purely Backend Applications

In this scenario, the web application focuses solely on the backend logic, devoid of UI-related components like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. These applications process requests, store data, and respond with data typically in JSON or XML format. The primary use case involves serving as a backend for frontend (BFF) in applications where the frontend is developed separately, such as Angular or React-based projects.

### Key Components:
1. **Spring Core:** Core functionalities from the Spring framework.
2. **Spring Boot:** Simplifies backend development, emphasizing microservices architecture.
3. **Spring Data:** Deals with the persistence layer and database interactions.
4. **Spring REST:** Enables building RESTful services for communication.
5. **Spring Security:** Ensures security measures within the backend.

This approach is suitable for scenarios where the frontend is decoupled, and the backend serves as a data provider via RESTful APIs.

## Combined Approach

It's worth noting that a combination of both approaches is feasible. A web application may have segments that serve RESTful APIs (purely backend) and other parts responsible for rendering views and handling user interactions (full-stack).

By exploring both types of web applications, developers gain a comprehensive understanding of how Spring can be leveraged for various project requirements.

With this knowledge, you are well-equipped to embark on building web applications using the Spring framework. I look forward to our continued exploration in the next lecture. Until then, goodbye!
