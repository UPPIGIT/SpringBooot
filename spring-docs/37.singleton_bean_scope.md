# Exploring the Singleton Bean Scope in Spring

In this lecture, we'll unravel the concept of the **Singleton** bean scope, a default behavior followed by the Spring IoC container.

When creating a bean for a specific Java class, if you haven't explicitly defined the scope, Spring automatically considers it a **singleton**. This means that whenever you reference this bean within your application—be it through the `getBean` method or using dependency injection and autowiring—you consistently receive the same instance of the bean.

The term "singleton" draws parallels to the Singleton design pattern in Java, where only one object instance exists throughout the entire application. In Spring, the similarity lies in having a single object instance for each bean, even if you create multiple beans of the same data type.

Let's consider an example using a `VehicleService` class, annotated with `@Component` for bean conversion. If we don't explicitly mention `@Scope("singleton")`, Spring defaults to singleton scope. To reinforce this, we can explicitly state the scope for improved readability, as demonstrated below:

```java
@Component
@Scope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
public class VehicleService {
    // Class implementation
}
```

Now, when we retrieve the bean using `getBean` multiple times, as shown in the example code, we receive the same object instance every time. The hash codes of `VehicleService` instances `vehicleService1` and `vehicleService2` will be identical, confirming the singleton behavior.

```java
VehicleService vehicleService1 = context.getBean(VehicleService.class);
VehicleService vehicleService2 = context.getBean("vehicleService", VehicleService.class);

// Confirming Singleton Scope
if (vehicleService1.hashCode() == vehicleService2.hashCode()) {
    System.out.println("VehicleService bean is a singleton-scoped bean.");
}
```

Understanding the singleton scope is crucial, but it's essential to be cautious. Improper handling of singleton-scoped beans can lead to race conditions in your application.

In the next lecture, we'll delve deeper into scenarios where you might want to reconsider using singleton-scoped beans and explore potential issues. Thank you, and I look forward to our continued discussion in the next lecture. Goodbye!
