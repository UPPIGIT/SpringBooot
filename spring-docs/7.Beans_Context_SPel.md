# Spring Framework Overview

In this lecture, we explore fundamental concepts in the Spring framework, building upon our previous discussions on Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI). We delve into the core elements of Spring, namely Beans, Context, and Spring Expression Language (SpEL), and their roles in facilitating loose coupling within web applications.

## 1. Spring Beans:

**Definition:**
A Spring bean is a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) class managed by the Spring IoC container. It undergoes instantiation, assembly, and maintenance by the container, promoting a modular and loosely coupled design.

**Example:**
Consider a `Vehicle` class representing a part of the business logic. By annotating it with `@Component`, we instruct Spring to manage it as a bean.

```java
@Component
public class Vehicle {
    // Class implementation
}
```

## 2. Context:

**Definition:**
The Spring context serves as the memory location within a web application where objects instantiated by the Spring IoC container are stored and managed. Proper configuration during startup dictates which objects are created and maintained within this context.

**Example:**
Configuring the `ApplicationContext` to scan specific packages for bean definitions.

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example")
public class AppConfig {
    // Configuration details
}
```

## 3. Spring Expression Language (SpEL):

**Definition:**
SpEL is a robust expression language in the Spring framework, facilitating dynamic querying and manipulation of object information at runtime. It is instrumental in tasks such as setting/getting property values, method invocation, and property assignments.

**Example:**
Using SpEL for property assignment in a bean definition.

```java
@Component
public class Person {
    @Value("#{systemProperties['user.name']}")
    private String username;

    // Getter and Setter methods
}
```

## 4. Configuration:

Developers define bean configurations using annotations or XML, guiding the Spring IoC container on which classes to manage and how to instantiate them.

## 5. Dependency Injection:

The Spring IoC container handles the injection of dependencies into beans, contributing to a flexible and decoupled architecture.

In upcoming lectures, we will explore the intricacies of configuring the Spring IoC container, discussing XML configurations and annotations in detail.

This overview provides a solid foundation for understanding key components in the Spring core. Feel free to ask for further clarification or examples during our upcoming sessions. Thank you, and I look forward to our next lecture!
