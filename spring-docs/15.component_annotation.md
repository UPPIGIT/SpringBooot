# Creating Beans with `@Component` Annotation in Spring

In this lecture, we'll explore how to create beans inside the Spring framework using the `@Component` annotation. The `@Component` annotation is part of the set of stereotype annotations in Spring, and it provides a simpler way to define beans compared to using `@Bean` annotation.

## Using `@Component` Annotation

To create a bean with the help of `@Component`, you can annotate your plain old Java class (POJO) with `@Component`. This indicates to the Spring framework that the class should be treated as a Spring bean.

```java
package com.example.beans;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class Vehicle {

    private String name;

    public void printHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello from Vehicle!");
    }

    // Getters and Setters for the 'name' variable
}
```

In this example, the `Vehicle` class is marked with `@Component`, making it eligible for registration as a Spring bean. Note that with `@Component`, you don't have to write additional methods for bean creation; the Spring framework handles the object creation.

## Configuring Component Scan

To make sure Spring knows where to look for `@Component`-annotated classes, you need to configure component scanning in your configuration class. In this case, it's the `ProjectConfig` class.

```java
package com.example.config;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.beans")
public class ProjectConfig {
    // Configuration class content (if any)
}
```

The `@ComponentScan` annotation, when placed on your configuration class, informs Spring where to look for component classes. The `basePackages` attribute specifies the package to scan for components.

## Accessing the Bean in Main Class

Now, in your main class (`ExampleFive`), you can access the bean created by Spring.

```java
package com.example;

import com.example.beans.Vehicle;
import com.example.config.ProjectConfig;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;

public class ExampleFive {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ProjectConfig.class);

        Vehicle vehicleBean = context.getBean(Vehicle.class);

        System.out.println("Name: " + vehicleBean.getName());  // This might print 'null'
        vehicleBean.printHello();  // This should print the 'Hello from Vehicle!' message

        context.close();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Vehicle` bean is retrieved from the Spring context using the `getBean` method, and its methods are then invoked.

Keep in mind that with `@Component`, you don't have control over the bean creation process, and you might not be able to set initial values for variables in a controlled way.

This approach is convenient for scenarios where you want a straightforward way to create beans, especially for utility or generic classes.

I hope this clarifies how to create Spring beans using the `@Component` annotation. Feel free to explore further and experiment with different stereotype annotations in Spring.
