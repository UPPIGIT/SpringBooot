# Maven Installation and Setup

In this lecture, we will guide you through the process of installing and setting up Maven on your local system. If you already have Maven installed, feel free to skip this section.

## Maven Overview:

Maven is a widely-used build tool in the Java ecosystem, providing essential functionalities for building and managing Java applications. It simplifies the process of handling dependencies, compiling code, running tests, and packaging applications. Maven's central repository allows for efficient management of libraries and ensures consistent builds across different environments.

## Installation Steps:

1. **Download Maven:**
   - Visit the official Maven website: [Maven Apache](https://maven.apache.org/).
   - Navigate to the "Download" section and choose the appropriate format for your operating system.
   - For Windows, download the `.zip` file containing binaries.
   - For Linux or Mac, download the `.tar` file.

2. **Extract Maven:**
   - Once the download is complete, extract the Maven binary archive to a preferred location on your local system.

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Open the System Properties on your computer.
   - Click on "Advanced system settings" and then on "Environment Variables."

4. **Create Maven Home Variable:**
   - Click "New" under the "User variables" section.
   - Set the variable name to `M2_HOME` and the variable value to the path where Maven is extracted.

5. **Update Path Variable:**
   - Find the `Path` variable under "System variables" and click "Edit."
   - Add a new entry with the value `%M2_HOME%\bin` to ensure the system can locate Maven binaries.

6. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a new command prompt or terminal.
   - Run the command `mvn --version` to check the Maven version.
   - Ensure there are no errors, indicating a successful installation.

By completing these steps, you have successfully installed and configured Maven on your local system.

**Note:** It's advisable to use Maven installed on your system even if your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) includes an embedded Maven. This ensures better control over Maven dependencies in your projects.

In the next lecture, we will proceed to create Spring beans using the Maven project structure. If you encounter any issues during the installation, feel free to ask for assistance. Happy coding!
