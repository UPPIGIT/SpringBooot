# Understanding Prototype Bean Scope in Spring

In this lecture, we'll explore the prototype bean scope in the Spring framework. The prototype scope is in direct contrast to the singleton bean scope. Here are the key characteristics and considerations associated with the prototype scope:

1. **Scope Behavior:**
   - In prototype scope, every time a bean reference is requested, a new object instance is created by the Spring IOC container.
   - This is especially useful in scenarios where the bean's state frequently changes, and you want to avoid race conditions in multithreaded environments.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Prototype scope needs to be explicitly configured, as it is not the default behavior.
   - Configuration is done by specifying `bean definition dot scope as prototype` for the desired bean.

3. **Example Demonstration:**
   - In the example, a `VehicleService` bean is configured with prototype scope.
   - The `getBean` method is used to request two bean references: `vehicleService1` and `vehicleService2`.
   - Since the scope is prototype, two distinct instances of the bean are created.

4. **Careful Usage:**
   - Use prototype scope when you are certain that the bean will frequently change its state.
   - Be cautious when injecting prototype beans into singleton beans, as the injected bean will act as a singleton within the singleton bean.

5. **Injection Consideration:**
   - If a prototype bean is injected into a singleton bean, the injected bean behaves like a singleton within the parent singleton.
   - However, when the prototype bean is accessed directly from the Spring IOC context, a new instance is returned.

6. **Demo Project - Example 6:**
   - The example project `example6` demonstrates the usage of the prototype scope with a `VehicleService` bean.
   - The hash codes of `vehicleService1` and `vehicleService2` are different, indicating the creation of two distinct instances.

7. **Injection into Singleton Beans:**
   - Be cautious when injecting prototype beans into singleton beans, as it may not behave as expected.

Understanding the prototype bean scope is crucial for scenarios where dynamic state changes and frequent object creation are required. Use prototype scope judiciously, considering the specific requirements of your application.

In the next lecture, we will explore further aspects of Spring bean scopes. Thank you, and I'll see you in the next session. Goodbye!

Certainly! Below is a simple Java code example that demonstrates the usage of prototype bean scope in a Spring application. This example uses annotations for configuration.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope;

@Configuration
public class PrototypeScopeExample {

    @Bean
    @Scope("prototype")
    public VehicleService vehicleService() {
        return new VehicleService();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(PrototypeScopeExample.class);

        // Request two bean references
        VehicleService vehicleService1 = context.getBean(VehicleService.class);
        VehicleService vehicleService2 = context.getBean(VehicleService.class);

        // Print hash codes to confirm two different instances
        System.out.println("Hash code of vehicleService1: " + vehicleService1.hashCode());
        System.out.println("Hash code of vehicleService2: " + vehicleService2.hashCode());

        // Close the application context
        context.close();
    }
}

class VehicleService {
    // Class representing the prototype-scoped bean
}
```

In this example:

1. The `PrototypeScopeExample` class is annotated with `@Configuration`, indicating that it contains Spring bean configurations.
2. The `VehicleService` class is annotated with `@Scope("prototype")`, specifying the prototype bean scope.
3. The `main` method creates an `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` based on the configuration in `PrototypeScopeExample`.
4. Two bean references (`vehicleService1` and `vehicleService2`) are requested from the Spring context.
5. The hash codes of the two instances are printed, confirming that distinct instances were created.

Remember to have the necessary Spring dependencies in your project. You can use a tool like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies.

This is a basic example to illustrate prototype bean scope. In a real-world application, you would have more complex scenarios and interactions between beans.
