In this lecture, the implementation of another aspect logic, `VehicleStartCheckAspect`, is introduced to check if the vehicle is started before proceeding with the actual business logic. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Create VehicleStartCheckAspect:**
   - A new aspect class, `VehicleStartCheckAspect`, is created in the package `com.example.aspects`.
   - It is annotated with `@Aspect` and `@Component`.
   - The `@Order(1)` annotation is used to specify the order of execution, with a value of 1.

   ```java
   @Aspect
   @Component
   @Order(1)
   public class VehicleStartCheckAspect {
       private final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(VehicleStartCheckAspect.class);

       @Before("execution(* com.example.services.*.*(..)) && args(vehicleStarted, ..)")
       public void checkVehicleStarted(JoinPoint joinPoint, boolean vehicleStarted) {
           if (!vehicleStarted) {
               logger.error("Vehicle is not started. Operation not allowed.");
               throw new RuntimeException("Vehicle is not started");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   - The `@Before` advice checks if the vehicle is started (`vehicleStarted` parameter). If not, it throws a runtime exception.

2. **Modify Actual Business Methods:**
   - In the `VehicleService` class, the redundant checks for whether the vehicle is started are commented out.

   ```java
   @Service
   public class VehicleService {
       @Autowired
       ReturnTypes returnTypes;

       public void moveVehicle() {
           // Business logic without unnecessary checks...
           returnTypes.rotate();
       }

       public void applyBrake() {
           // Business logic without unnecessary checks...
           returnTypes.stop();
       }
   }
   ```

   - The redundant code for checking whether the vehicle is started is now handled by the `VehicleStartCheckAspect`.

3. **Ordering Aspects:**
   - The `@Order` annotation is used to specify the order of execution for aspects.
   - `VehicleStartCheckAspect` is given an order of 1, indicating it should execute before other aspects.

   ```java
   @Aspect
   @Component
   @Order(2)
   public class LoggerAspect {
       // LoggerAspect implementation...
   }
   ```

4. **Executing the Application:**
   - By setting `vehicleStarted` to `false`, the `VehicleStartCheckAspect` will throw a runtime exception, preventing the execution of business logic.

   ```java
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       // ...
       vehicleService.moveVehicle();  // Throws RuntimeException from VehicleStartCheckAspect
   }
   ```

   - After setting `vehicleStarted` to `true`, the application executes successfully, and both aspects (`VehicleStartCheckAspect` and `LoggerAspect`) run in the specified order.

   ```java
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       // ...
       vehicleService.moveVehicle();  // VehicleStartCheckAspect -> LoggerAspect -> Business Logic
   }
   ```

By using aspects, redundant checks for vehicle start conditions are removed from the actual business methods, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code. Aspects provide a powerful way to modularize cross-cutting concerns in applications.
