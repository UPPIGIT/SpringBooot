# Understanding Bean Scopes in Spring

In our course journey, we've covered the fundamental aspects of Spring, such as creating beans, defining dependencies, and employing dependency injection and autowiring. However, a crucial topic we have yet to explore is the intricate process of how and when Spring's IoC (Inversion of Control) container creates beans.

In a recent assignment, we examined a scenario where the 'Person' bean had a dependency on the 'Vehicle' bean, and the 'Vehicle' bean, in turn, relied on the 'VehicleServices' bean. Each time the 'Vehicle' bean requested a 'VehicleServices' bean from Spring, it dynamically injected and provided the bean at runtime. This dynamic behavior empowered our application to execute diverse business logics, such as playing music or maneuvering the vehicle.

As we progress, a critical question arises: In a production environment with multiple concurrent threads and users, how does Spring manage bean dependencies? Does it consistently provide the same bean reference or create a new instance for each request? These queries are intricately linked to the concept of **scopes** in Spring.

**Bean scope** is the parameter that dictates how a bean should be created and maintained by the Spring IoC container. It answers the fundamental question of whether a bean persists throughout the application's lifecycle or if a new instance is spawned for each request. Spring offers five primary bean scopes:

1. **Singleton**: This is the default scope, maintaining a single bean instance throughout the application.
2. **Prototype**: A new bean instance is created whenever requested, ensuring freshness.
3. **Request**: Primarily for web applications, a new bean is instantiated for each HTTP request.
4. **Session**: Also web-centric, this scope maintains a single bean per user session.
5. **Application**: Another web-oriented scope, this maintains a single bean for the entire application context.

In these early stages of our course, we'll delve into understanding the **Singleton** (default) and **Prototype** scopes. We aim to discern when each scope is appropriate based on specific project requirements.

Now armed with an overview of the available scopes, in the upcoming lecture, we'll plunge into the specifics of the **Singleton** scopeâ€”the default behavior of the Spring framework.

Thank you for your attention, and I eagerly anticipate our continued exploration in the next lecture. Until then, farewell!
