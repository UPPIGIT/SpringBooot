# Creating a Spring Boot Web Application

In this lecture, we'll explore how to create a web application using the Spring Boot framework. Unlike the traditional approach that required developers to set up templates or skeletons manually, Spring Boot simplifies this process.

## 1. Creating a Web Application

The most common and standard approach for creating a Spring Boot web application is by using the [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) website. This website is officially maintained by the Spring team, making it a reliable source for generating Spring Boot projects.

Other options include using tools provided by the Spring website, such as [spring.io/tools](https://spring.io/tools), which offers plugins for various IDEs like Visual Studio Code and Eclipse. IntelliJ IDEA also provides plugins to generate Spring Boot web applications from the IDE itself.

### Steps to Create a Web Application:

1. **Visit [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/).**
2. Choose the following options based on your project requirements:
   - **Project:** Maven
   - **Language:** Java
   - **Spring Boot Version:** Choose the default stable version (e.g., 3.0.6).
   - **Group:** com.easybytes
   - **Artifact:** example_18 (naming convention for the example in this lecture)
   - **Description:** Eazy School Web Application
   - **Package:** com.eazybytes.easyschool
   - **Packaging:** Jar (or War based on deployment needs)
   - **Java:** 17 (Java version compatible with Spring Boot 3.0)
3. Add the **Spring Web** dependency under "Add Dependencies."

After configuring these options, click on the "Generate" button. This will download a zip file containing the basic structure of the Spring Boot web application.

### 2. Importing the Project into IDE

1. **Extract the downloaded zip file.**
2. Import the project into your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The lecture demonstrates using IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Go to File > New > Module from Existing Sources.
   - Select the extracted directory containing the pom.xml file.
   - Click "OK" to import the project.

### 3. Exploring the Project Structure

Once the project is imported, you'll find a predefined template structure. Key elements include:

- **pom.xml:** Contains project configurations and dependencies.
- **src/main/java:** Java source code.
- **src/test/java:** Test source code.
- **src/main/resources:** Resources such as application properties, static files, and templates.

The main class, identified by the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation, is typically named `Application` and resides in the `src/main/java` directory.

## Conclusion

In this lecture, we've covered the steps to create a Spring Boot web application using the [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) website. We've imported the project into IntelliJ IDEA and briefly explored the project structure. In the next lecture, we'll make some modifications to the project and showcase a simple Hello World demo.

Stay tuned, and I'll see you in the next lecture!
