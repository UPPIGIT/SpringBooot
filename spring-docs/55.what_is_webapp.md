# Welcome back.

In the preceding sections of this course, we delved into the foundational concepts of the Spring framework. We explored beans, their creation, and the intricate concepts of dependency injection and inversion of control. Furthermore, we examined the intriguing realm of aspect-oriented programming, unraveling the various types of aspects that can be integrated into our applications. This groundwork was crucial to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles of the Spring framework.

Now, we transition to the next phase of our exploration: web applications. Spring provides a robust framework for building web applications, making it a cornerstone for developers and organizations in their day-to-day operations.

Before we delve into the intricacies of constructing web applications with Spring, let's take a moment to comprehend what a web application truly is.

## Understanding Web Applications

A web application is a software product deployed onto a server, commonly referred to as a web server or app server. The deployment facilitates the acceptance of requests from external sources, such as browsers, mobile applications, or tools like Postman. Consider popular web applications like Facebook. The act of deploying the Facebook application onto a server allows users to engage with the platform, upload images, and view videos. In essence, any application accessible over the internet falls under the category of a web application.

### The Interaction: Request and Response

The process unfolds as a web client initiates a request, reaching out to the web server via HTTP protocol. The server processes the request and responds, creating a seamless interaction. This communication is orchestrated by a web server, maintaining applications that can consist of frontend, backend, or a fusion of both.

- **Frontend**: The user-visible part of the application where code is exposed, often involving HTML pages. Think of it as the visible elements like tables and chairs in a restaurant.

- **Backend**: The concealed part where the business logic operates, hidden from the end user. In the restaurant analogy, it corresponds to the kitchen where the actual food preparation occurs.

### Frontend and Backend Dynamics

Frontend applications can be static or dynamic. Static frontend code presents fixed information, while dynamic frontend and backend combinations enable the display of data based on user actions. Notable examples include e-commerce websites like Amazon or eBay.

In some cases, applications may exclusively consist of a backend, communicating with frontend applications via REST APIs and JSON. This approach is common when using frameworks like Angular or React for frontend development.

### Role of Servlet Containers

Java, being an object-oriented language, relies on servlet containers to interpret HTTP messages. Servlet containers, like Apache Tomcat, serve as intermediaries. They convert HTTP messages into servlet requests, process them, and then transform servlet responses back into HTTP messages for display on browsers.

This mechanism ensures that the backend, equipped with business logic, can seamlessly communicate with frontend components while adhering to the HTTP protocol.

With these foundational concepts in place, we're poised to explore the intricacies of building web applications using the Spring framework in the upcoming lectures.

Thank you, and I look forward to our continued journey. See you in the next lecture!
