# Handling "No Unique Bean Definition" Exception in Spring

In this lecture, we'll dive into a common exception in the Spring framework known as the "No Unique Bean Definition" exception. This exception arises when there are multiple bean definitions of the same data type, and the Spring IOC container encounters ambiguity during bean resolution.

## Understanding the Exception

Consider a scenario where you, as a developer, declare multiple beans of the same data type, as shown in the example below:

```java
@Configuration
public class ProjectConfig {

    @Bean
    public Vehicle vehicleOne() {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
        vehicle.setName("Audi");
        return vehicle;
    }

    @Bean
    public Vehicle vehicleTwo() {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
        vehicle.setName("Honda");
        return vehicle;
    }

    @Bean
    public Vehicle vehicleThree() {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
        vehicle.setName("Ferrari");
        return vehicle;
    }
}
```

In this example, three beans of type `Vehicle` are defined with different names (`vehicleOne`, `vehicleTwo`, and `vehicleThree`). During initialization, the Spring context loads all these beans, but when you attempt to fetch a bean using `context.getBean(Vehicle.class)`, an exception is thrown because of ambiguity.

## Resolving the Exception

To resolve this exception, you need to provide additional information to the `getBean` method. Instead of relying solely on the data type, you should also specify the bean name:

```java
Vehicle vehicle = context.getBean("vehicleOne", Vehicle.class);
```

By passing both the bean name ("vehicleOne") and the data type (`Vehicle.class`), you eliminate the ambiguity, and Spring can successfully locate the desired bean.

## Example in Java Application

Let's illustrate this scenario in a Java application. I've created a new Maven project named "ExampleTwo" with a configuration class and a main class. We intentionally trigger the "No Unique Bean Definition" exception and then resolve it using the provided method parameters.

```java
public class ExampleTwo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ProjectConfig.class);

        // Uncommenting the line below will trigger the exception
        // Vehicle vehicle = context.getBean(Vehicle.class);

        // Resolving the exception by specifying the bean name
        Vehicle vehicle = context.getBean("vehicleOne", Vehicle.class);
        System.out.println("Vehicle name from Spring context: " + vehicle.getName());

        context.close();
    }
}
```

In this example, attempting to fetch the `Vehicle` bean without specifying the bean name triggers the exception. By providing both the bean name and the data type, we successfully resolve the ambiguity.

Understanding and addressing the "No Unique Bean Definition" exception is crucial for effective bean management in Spring applications. As we progress through this course, we'll explore additional approaches to handle such scenarios.
