# Understanding Race Conditions in Singleton Bean Scopes

Before delving into the discussion of when to use and avoid Singleton bean scopes, let's take a moment to understand what a **race condition** is.

**Race condition** occurs when two or more threads attempt to access the same shared value simultaneously. In the example below, consider a shared object—a HashMap named `reservedTables`—within an application. Threads, denoted as Thread 1 and Thread 2, concurrently attempt to access and update this shared object:

```java
// Shared Object: reservedTables (a HashMap)
// Initial state: reservedTables.isEmpty() returns true

if (!reservedTables.containsKey("table1")) {
    // If condition is true for both Thread 1 and Thread 2
    // Both threads enter the if block concurrently

    // Thread 1: Assigning table1 to user1
    reservedTables.put("table1", "user1");

    // Thread 2: Assigning table1 to user2
    reservedTables.put("table1", "user2");

    // Race condition: The final value depends on which thread completes last
}
```

In this scenario, both threads race to update the shared value, resulting in unpredictable outcomes. The final state of `reservedTables` depends on which thread completes its update last. This unpredictability and inconsistency in the shared data illustrate a race condition.

Similarly, when dealing with Singleton bean scope objects in Spring, which have a single object instance for the entire application, the risk of encountering race conditions arises. If multiple threads, at various points in the application, attempt to access and modify the singleton bean, race conditions can occur.

As developers, it becomes our responsibility to ensure that singleton-scoped beans do not involve data updates, corrections, or deletions that could lead to race conditions. While synchronization and locking mechanisms can be used in Java to address race conditions, implementing these in a Spring application can be complex.

Therefore, when choosing the singleton scope for a bean, it's essential to consider whether it may result in race conditions. In the next lecture, we'll explore the specific use cases where opting for singleton bean scopes is appropriate.

Thank you, and I look forward to our continued discussion in the next lecture. Goodbye!
