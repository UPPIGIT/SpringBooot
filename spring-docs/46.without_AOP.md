## Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): Problem Statement

In this section, we'll address a common problem in application development and understand how Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) can provide a solution. To illustrate this, we'll explore a sample Java application named "Example 17."

### Problem Statement:

Consider the `VehicleService` class within the Spring context, annotated as a `@Component`. This class has three methods: `playMusic`, `moveVehicle`, and `applyBrake`. Each method involves some non-functional requirements, such as logging, security checks, and time tracking.

#### `VehicleService` Class:
```java
@Component
public class VehicleService {

    @Autowired
    private Speakers speakers;

    @Autowired
    private Tyres tyres;

    public String playMusic() {
        // Non-functional requirements
        logStart();
        checkVehicleStarted();
        Instant start = Instant.now();

        // Business logic
        String sound = speakers.makeSound();

        // Non-functional requirements
        Instant finish = Instant.now();
        logTimeElapsed(start, finish);
        logEnd();

        return sound;
    }

    public void moveVehicle() {
        // Non-functional requirements
        logStart();
        checkVehicleStarted();
        Instant start = Instant.now();

        // Business logic
        tyres.rotate();

        // Non-functional requirements
        Instant finish = Instant.now();
        logTimeElapsed(start, finish);
        logEnd();
    }

    public void applyBrake() {
        // Non-functional requirements
        logStart();
        checkVehicleStarted();
        Instant start = Instant.now();

        // Business logic
        tyres.stop();

        // Non-functional requirements
        Instant finish = Instant.now();
        logTimeElapsed(start, finish);
        logEnd();
    }

    // Non-functional requirements methods
    private void logStart() {
        // Logging logic
    }

    private void checkVehicleStarted() {
        // Security check
    }

    private void logTimeElapsed(Instant start, Instant finish) {
        // Time tracking logic
    }

    private void logEnd() {
        // Logging logic
    }
}
```

### Issues with the Current Approach:

1. **Code Complexity:**
   - The business logic is cluttered with non-functional requirements, increasing code complexity.
   - A developer new to the codebase may find it challenging to understand the actual business logic.

2. **Redundancy:**
   - Non-functional code, such as logging, security checks, and time tracking, is repeated across multiple methods.
   - Any modification or addition to these non-functional requirements would require changes in every method.

3. **Maintenance Challenges:**
   - Making changes to security checks or adding new conditions involves modifying multiple methods.
   - Testing is required for each method after modifications, making maintenance challenging.

### Solution with Aspect-Oriented Programming:

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) provides a solution to these issues by allowing the separation of non-functional requirements from business logic. In the next lectures, we'll explore how to use AOP to move non-functional code into separate aspects. This separation results in cleaner, more maintainable methods with a focus on business logic.

Stay tuned as we dive into the details of configuring and implementing Aspect-Oriented Programming in Spring Framework.

Thank you, and I'll see you in the next lecture.


Certainly! Let's consider a real-world example where Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) can be applied. We'll use logging as a common use case for AOP. Imagine a web application where you want to log the time taken by each method in a service layer for performance monitoring.

### Without AOP:

```java
public class UserService {

    private UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public User getUserById(Long userId) {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

        // Business logic to retrieve user from the repository
        User user = userRepository.getUserById(userId);

        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        System.out.println("getUserById execution time: " + (endTime - startTime) + " milliseconds");

        return user;
    }

    // Other methods in the service class
}
```

In this example, we've manually added the timing log around the `getUserById` method. If you have multiple methods in different classes, adding this logging code to each method can be repetitive and clutters the business logic.

### With AOP:

Now, let's use AOP to handle the logging aspect separately.

```java
import org.aspectj.lang.JoinPoint;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.After;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Before method execution: " + joinPoint.getSignature());
    }

    @After("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logAfter(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("After method execution: " + joinPoint.getSignature());
    }
}
```

Now, the `LoggingAspect` class contains advice methods that will run before and after the execution of any method in the `com.example.service` package. This allows us to capture the method execution time without modifying the actual service methods.

With AOP, you can easily apply this logging behavior to multiple service classes and methods by specifying the pointcut expression, making your code cleaner and more modular. This is especially useful in large-scale applications where logging, security, or other cross-cutting concerns need to be applied consistently across various components.
