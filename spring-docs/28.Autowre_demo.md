# Wiring Beans in Spring: @Autowired Annotation

In this lecture, we'll delve into a more convenient and widely-used approach for autowiring beans in Spring: the `@Autowired` annotation. This annotation simplifies the process of injecting dependencies and enhances the readability of your code.

## Introduction to @Autowired

On the left side of the screen, you can observe the updated `Person` class and the `ProjectConfig` class. The `Person` class now has the `@Autowired` annotation applied to the `vehicle` field. This annotation signals to Spring that this field should be automatically populated with a bean of type `Vehicle` during the bean creation process.

### Code Changes in `Person.java`

```java
public class Person {

    private String name;

    @Autowired // Using @Autowired for Dependency Injection
    private Vehicle vehicle;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters...
}
```

### Updated Code in `ProjectConfig.java`

In the `ProjectConfig` class, the `@Bean`-annotated `person` method remains unchanged. However, the `@Autowired` annotation is no longer required as the injection is handled automatically based on the method parameters.

```java
@Configuration
public class ProjectConfig {

    @Bean
    public Vehicle vehicle() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle bean created by Spring.");
        return new Vehicle("Toyota");
    }

    @Bean
    public Person person(Vehicle vehicle) {
        System.out.println("Person bean created by Spring.");
        return new Person("Lucy", vehicle);
    }
}
```

### Main Class (`Main.java`)

In the `Main` class, obtaining the beans and printing their details remains the same. The `@Autowired` annotation simplifies the process, and the output should be consistent with the previous examples.

### Output

Executing the program should produce output similar to the earlier examples, demonstrating the successful establishment of the relationship between the `Person` and `Vehicle` beans.

## Advantages of @Autowired Annotation

- **Simplicity:** The `@Autowired` annotation simplifies the process of dependency injection, reducing the need for explicit configurations.
- **Readability:** Using annotations improves the readability of the code, making it clearer that a field is being injected.

## Conclusion

By adopting the `@Autowired` annotation, you enhance the readability and maintainability of your Spring applications. Understanding this approach is crucial as it is widely used in real-world Spring projects.
