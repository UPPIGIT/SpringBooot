# Overriding Default Configurations in Spring Boot

In this lecture, we'll explore how to override default configurations provided by Spring Boot. While Spring Boot's conventional auto-configuration is convenient, there are scenarios where developers may want to customize certain behaviors.

## Modifying Default Port and Context Path

By default, Spring Boot uses Tomcat as an embedded server, and the default port is 8080. Additionally, the context path is assumed to be blank. However, developers can easily override these settings by specifying custom configurations in the `application.properties` file.

1. Open the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory.

2. Add the following properties to override the default port and set a custom context path:

    ```properties
    # Override default port
    server.port=8081
    
    # Override default context path
    server.servlet.context-path=/eazyschool
    ```

    - `server.port`: Specifies the port number for the application (in this example, 8081).
    - `server.servlet.context-path`: Specifies the context path for the application (in this example, `/eazyschool`).

3. Save the `application.properties` file.

## Starting the Application

To see these changes in action, start the Spring Boot application. Locate the main class, usually annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` (in this case, `EazySchoolApplication`), and run it.

The application will now start on port 8081 with the context path `/eazyschool`.

## Testing the Changes

Access the home URL by modifying the previous URL pattern to include the updated port and context path:

- Previously: `http://localhost:8080/home`
- Updated: `http://localhost:8081/eazyschool/home`

The expected output should be "Welcome to EazySchool."

## Reverting to Default Configuration

In the lecture, it was mentioned that the custom configurations were commented out. If you wish to revert to the default configurations (8080 port and no context path), comment or remove the custom configuration lines from `application.properties`.

```properties
# Default configurations (commented out)
# server.port=8081
# server.servlet.context-path=/eazyschool
```

Save the changes and restart the application.

## Conclusion

Customizing configurations in Spring Boot is a powerful feature, allowing developers to adapt the application's behavior to specific requirements. However, it's important to be cautious when overriding defaults, ensuring compatibility with other components and libraries.

In the next lecture, we'll dive deeper into Spring Boot features and explore more concepts related to building web applications.
