# Eager vs Lazy Instantiation of Singleton Beans in Spring

In the world of Spring, when dealing with **Singleton Beans**, the Spring IoC container, by default, follows an approach known as **eager instantiation**. This means that all singleton beans are initialized during the startup of the application, regardless of whether they are immediately used or not.

However, there might be scenarios where creating all beans during startup could be inefficient, especially for beans associated with rare or remote scenarios that might not be frequently used. To address this, Spring provides an alternative approach called **lazy instantiation**.

In **lazy instantiation**, the Spring IoC container delays the creation of a singleton bean until the moment it is first requested by the application. This can save memory and potentially improve performance, especially when dealing with beans that handle infrequent or remote business logic.

Despite the flexibility of lazy instantiation, it comes with a caveat. If an exception occurs during the creation of a lazily instantiated bean, it won't be detected during the application startup. Instead, it may lead to runtime exceptions when the bean is accessed for the first time.

### Sample Demo

Here's a quick example to illustrate lazy instantiation using the `@Lazy` annotation:

```java
@Component
@Lazy
public class Person {
    
    public Person() {
        System.out.println("Person Bean created by Spring");
    }
    
    // Other methods and properties
}
```

In this example, the `Person` bean is marked with `@Lazy`, indicating that it should be lazily instantiated. When the application starts, the message "Person Bean created by Spring" will only be printed to the console when the `Person` bean is accessed for the first time using `getBean` or through dependency injection.

Remember, while lazy instantiation can be useful in specific scenarios, it's generally advisable to stick with the default eager instantiation, as it helps identify and address potential issues during application startup.

In the upcoming lecture, we'll explore a simple Java application that demonstrates both eager and lazy instantiation of singleton beans.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to our continued exploration in the next lecture. Goodbye!
