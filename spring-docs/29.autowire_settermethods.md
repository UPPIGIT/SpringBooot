# Autowiring with @Autowired Annotation: Setter Method Approach

In this lecture, we'll explore another flavor of using the `@Autowired` annotation in Spring for autowiring. Unlike the previous approach where `@Autowired` was applied directly to a field, this time we'll apply it to a setter method.

## Autowiring with Setter Method

On the left side of the screen, you can observe that the `@Autowired` annotation is now placed on the setter method within the `Person` class. This approach is an alternative to placing the annotation directly on the class field.

```java
public class Person {

    private String name;
    private Vehicle vehicle;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters...

    @Autowired // Using @Autowired on the Setter Method
    public void setVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        this.vehicle = vehicle;
    }
}
```

This approach is beneficial when you want to leverage the setter method for dependency injection. The setter method is a standard practice in Java POJO classes, where you typically define getters and setters for accessing and updating field values.

Let's implement this approach in our example Maven project named **Example11**.

### Code Changes in `Person.java`

```java
public class Person {

    private String name;
    private Vehicle vehicle;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters...

    @Autowired // Using @Autowired on the Setter Method
    public void setVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        this.vehicle = vehicle;
    }
}
```

### Main Class (`Main.java`)

No changes are required in the `Main` class, as we are obtaining and printing the beans in the same way.

### Output

Executing the program should produce output similar to the previous examples, indicating that the relationship between the `Person` and `Vehicle` beans has been successfully established.

## Advantages of Autowiring with Setter Method

- **Standard Practice:** Leveraging setter methods aligns with the standard practice in Java for setting values in a class.
- **Flexibility:** This approach provides flexibility in handling dependencies and avoids potential issues related to final fields.

## Conclusion

Understanding different approaches to autowiring with `@Autowired` provides flexibility in Spring applications. Whether applied directly to a field, on a setter method, or within constructor parameters (as we'll discuss in the next lecture), these approaches cater to different scenarios in your projects.

In the upcoming lecture, we'll explore autowiring through constructor injection, offering another perspective on managing dependencies in your Spring application. See you in the next lecture!
