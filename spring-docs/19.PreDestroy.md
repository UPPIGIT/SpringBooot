# Using @PreDestroy Annotation for Bean Destruction

In the previous lecture, we explored the `@PostConstruct` annotation, which allows developers to execute custom initialization logic once a bean is created by the Spring IoC container. In this lecture, we will discuss the counterpart of `@PostConstruct`â€”the `@PreDestroy` annotation.

## Understanding @PreDestroy Annotation

- **Purpose:** `@PreDestroy` is a Spring framework annotation used to specify custom destruction logic for a bean.

- **Usage:**
  1. **Method Creation:** Create a method inside the class annotated with `@Component` or any other stereotype annotation.
  2. **Annotation:** Annotate the created method with `@PreDestroy`.
  3. **Custom Logic:** Write the custom destruction logic inside the annotated method.

- **Execution Time:** The annotated method will be executed automatically just before the bean is destroyed by the Spring IoC container.

## Example: Using @PreDestroy with @Component

On the left-hand side, you can observe the usage of `@Component` on the `Vehicle` class. Additionally, there is a method named `destroy` annotated with `@PreDestroy`. In this method, a statement is printed indicating the destruction of the vehicle bean.

```java
@Component
public class Vehicle {
    // Other methods and variables...

    @PreDestroy
    public void destroy() {
        System.out.println("Destroying vehicle bean.");
        // Custom destruction logic...
    }
}
```

On the right-hand side, in the main class (`MainClass`), the `close` method of the Spring `ApplicationContext` is called, initiating the destruction of beans and executing the custom logic inside the `destroy` method.

```java
public class MainClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
        // Other operations...
        context.close();
    }
}
```

## Maven Project Example: Using @PreDestroy

In the existing Maven project named `example-six`, the `Vehicle` class has been updated to include a `destroy` method annotated with `@PreDestroy`. This method is called automatically just before the bean is destroyed by the Spring IoC container.

```java
@Component
public class Vehicle {
    // Other methods and variables...

    @PreDestroy
    public void destroy() {
        System.out.println("Destroying vehicle bean.");
        // Custom destruction logic...
    }
}
```

Upon executing the main class (`MainClass`), you can observe the statement indicating the destruction of the vehicle bean.

```java
public class MainClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
        // Other operations...
        context.close();
    }
}
```

## Key Takeaways:

- **@PreDestroy Benefits:** Allows developers to define custom logic executed just before the destruction of a bean by the Spring IoC container.
- **Usage Scenario:** Useful when custom cleanup or resource release is needed before bean destruction.
- **Inspired by Java EE:** Similar to `@PostConstruct`, `@PreDestroy` is inspired by the Java Enterprise Edition.

While the usage of `@PreDestroy` is less common compared to `@PostConstruct`, it provides a valuable option when there is a need for custom destruction logic. In practice, it can be used to close resources such as database connections or perform any cleanup activities before a bean is destroyed.

Thank you, and I'll see you in the next lecture. Bye.
