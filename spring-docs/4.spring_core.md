# Understanding Spring Core Concepts

## Spring Ecosystem

In the previous lectures, we explored an overview of Spring and its relationship with Jakarta Enterprise Edition. Now, before diving into creating Spring applications, let's delve into the core concepts that form the foundation of the Spring framework.

Spring is not a singular framework but a diverse collection of more than 50 frameworks, each addressing specific scenarios in web application development. Notable projects include Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Spring Security, which cater to distinct aspects such as handling security, building microservices, and more.

At the core of all these projects is **"Spring Core,"** serving as the foundation for the entire Spring framework.

## Spring Core Components

### 1. Inversion of Control (IoC)

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a fundamental concept that allows the framework to control the flow of program execution. In traditional programming, where the flow is determined by program logic, IoC delegates control to an external framework.

**Example:**
```java
// Traditional approach
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SomeService service = new SomeService();
        service.doSomething();
    }
}

// With Spring IoC
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("spring-config.xml");
        SomeService service = context.getBean(SomeService.class);
        service.doSomething();
    }

**Example:**
```java
// Traditional approach
public class MyApp {

        SomeService service = new SomeService();
        service.doSomething();
    }
}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("spring-config.xml");
        SomeService service = context.getBean(SomeService.class);
        service.doSomething();
    }
```

### 2. Dependency Injection (DI)

Dependency Injection is a design pattern where a class receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them. Spring's IoC container manages DI, enhancing flexibility and testability.

**Example:**
```java
// Without Dependency Injection
public class OrderService {
    private PaymentService paymentService = new PaymentService();

    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        paymentService.processPayment(order);
    }
}

// With Dependency Injection
public class OrderService {
    private PaymentService paymentService;

    public OrderService(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }

    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        paymentService.processPayment(order);
    }
}
```

### 3. Beans

Beans are fundamental building blocks in Spring applications. They are Java objects managed by the Spring IoC container.

**Example:**
```java
// A simple bean
public class MyBean {
    private String message;

    // Getter and Setter methods
}
```

### 4. ApplicationContext

ApplicationContext is a container responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling beans. It acts as an IoC container and provides essential functionalities for application development.

**Example:**
```java
// Creating an ApplicationContext
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("spring-config.xml");
MyBean myBean = context.getBean(MyBean.class);
```

### 5. Spring Expression Language (SpEL)

SpEL is a powerful expression language allowing querying and manipulation of objects during runtime. It is used for querying beans, injecting values, and more.

**Example:**
```java
// Using SpEL to set a property
@Value("#{systemProperties['user.country']}")
private String userCountry;
```

### 6. IoC Container

The IoC Container is responsible for managing the complete lifecycle of beans. There are two types: BeanFactory and ApplicationContext.

**Example:**
```java
// Creating an IoC Container
BeanFactory beanFactory = new XmlBeanFactory(new ClassPathResource("spring-config.xml"));
MyBean myBean = (MyBean) beanFactory.getBean("myBean");
```

## Importance of Spring Core

Mastering Spring Core concepts is imperative before venturing into Spring application development. Topics like IoC, DI, beans, ApplicationContext, and SpEL lay the groundwork for building robust and efficient applications using the Spring framework.

In the upcoming lectures, we will delve deeper into each of these concepts with more examples to ensure a comprehensive understanding.

Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to continuing our exploration of Spring Core in the next lecture. Bye!


# Understanding Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection

In the previous lecture, we discussed that Spring Core is built based upon the principles of Inversion of Control (IoC). Now, let's delve into what Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection mean.

## Inversion of Control (IoC)

Inversion of Control (IoC), or simply IOC, is a fundamental software design principle applicable across various programming languages and frameworks such as Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript. The IoC principle advocates that instead of directly creating objects or dependencies within a program, this responsibility should be delegated to an external entity or framework.

### Key Aspects of IoC:

1. **Decentralized Control:** IoC shifts the control of object creation and flow from the application to an external container or framework.
   
2. **Reduced Coupling:** By relying on an external entity for object creation, components become loosely coupled, promoting a more modular and maintainable codebase.

3. **Framework-agnostic:** IoC is not tied to a specific framework; it is a software design philosophy embraced across the software development landscape.

In the early 2000s, the traditional approach involved programmers directly creating objects and defining dependencies in their programs, resulting in code that was harder to maintain and scale. The IoC principle emerged to provide guidelines for a more scalable and maintainable approach to software development.

## Dependency Injection (DI)

Dependency Injection (DI) is a pattern through which IoC is achieved. DI is not confined to a specific programming language or framework; it is a widely adopted design pattern found in frameworks like Angular, React.js, C#, and Python.

### Key Points about Dependency Injection:

1. **Flexibility:** DI enhances flexibility and testability by allowing a class to receive its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them internally.

2. **Loose Coupling:** DI promotes loose coupling by ensuring that components do not directly create their dependencies but receive them from an external source.

3. **Code Reusability:** Through Dependency Injection, components become more modular and reusable, as they can be easily injected into different contexts.

In the context of Spring Framework:

- **IoC Container:** In Spring, the IoC container takes charge of managing object creation and flow. The container is responsible for injecting dependencies into the components.

- **Annotations:** Spring leverages annotations like `@Autowired` to facilitate Dependency Injection. Developers use annotations to indicate the injection points for dependencies.

To summarize:

- **Inversion of Control (IoC):** A software design principle emphasizing external control over object creation and program flow.
  
- **Dependency Injection (DI):** An implementation of IoC, it is a design pattern fostering flexibility, loose coupling, and code reusability.

In the next lecture, we will explore a program to demonstrate why adopting Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection is beneficial with the help of Spring Framework.

Thank you, and I'll see you in the next lecture. Bye!
