# Understanding the Role of Servlets in Web Applications

In the previous lecture, we gained insights into the high-level concept of web applications and the pivotal role played by servlet containers, such as Apache Tomcat, in handling HTTP messages. Now, let's delve deeper into the historical context and understand the role servlets played in web development before the advent of the Spring framework.

## Legacy Web Development

In the pre-Spring era, developers faced the challenge of manually creating servlets for each distinct URL path their web applications intended to serve. Consider an example where a web application hosted at `example.com` has three URL paths: `/home`, `/login`, and `/dashboard`. Developers were compelled to create servlets such as `HomeServlet`, `LoginServlet`, and `DashboardServlet` to handle the logic associated with these paths.

Furthermore, developers had to configure these servlets in the `web.xml` file, mapping each servlet to its corresponding URL path. This process involved a considerable amount of manual configuration and code, creating a potential source of complexity and redundancy.

When the web application was deployed into a server (servlet container), such as Apache Tomcat, the servlet container utilized the configurations from `web.xml` to route incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate servlets. Subsequently, each servlet executed its specific business logic, and the resulting servlet response was converted back into an HTTP response message for display in the web client's browser.

## Enter the Spring Framework

With the introduction of the Spring framework, a paradigm shift occurred in web development. Developers were no longer required to create servlets for each URL path or manually configure servlet mappings. The Spring framework introduced a built-in servlet known as the **DispatcherServlet**.

### The DispatcherServlet in Spring

The DispatcherServlet is an integral part of the Spring framework and serves as a smart dispatcher for HTTP requests. Developers now only need to make minimal configurations within their web application, and the DispatcherServlet takes care of the rest.

In a Spring-based web application:

- **No Manual Servlet Creation**: Developers are relieved from the burden of creating servlets for each URL path.

- **Reduced Configuration**: The DispatcherServlet dynamically detects configurations within the application, eliminating the need for extensive `web.xml` configurations.

- **Single Servlet Handling**: Unlike the traditional approach with multiple servlets, the DispatcherServlet efficiently manages all incoming requests.

- **Streamlined Development**: Developers can focus more on application logic and less on servlet-related boilerplate code.

### Note on Servlet Usage

While Spring has significantly simplified web development by handling servlet-related intricacies internally, it's important to note that servlets are not obsolete. The responsibility has shifted from developers to the Spring framework, which efficiently manages the routing and processing of HTTP requests.

In modern Spring-based web applications, you'll rarely find developers directly working with servlets. However, a foundational understanding of servlets enhances your comprehension of the web application development landscape.

In conclusion, the Spring framework, with its DispatcherServlet, has transformed web development, offering a more streamlined and developer-friendly approach.

With this knowledge, we move forward in our exploration of web application development using the Spring framework. I'll see you in the next lecture. Goodbye!
