# Understanding Spring Boot Auto Configuration

In this lecture, we'll delve into the powerful feature of Spring Boot known as Auto Configuration. Spring Boot simplifies the process of setting up and configuring a Spring application by automatically creating beans and configurations based on the dependencies defined in the project's `pom.xml` file.

## Enabling Auto Configuration Report

To explore and understand the Auto Configuration performed by Spring Boot, you can generate an Auto Configuration report. Add the following property to your `application.properties` file:

```properties
# Enable debug mode to generate the Auto Configuration report
debug=true
```

This setting instructs Spring Boot to start the web application in debug mode, providing more detailed information, including the Auto Configuration report.

## Viewing the Auto Configuration Report

When you start your Spring Boot application, check the console for the Auto Configuration report. The report provides valuable insights into which configurations and beans are created based on the project's dependencies.

### Positive Matches

- **Positive Matches** indicate that Spring Boot successfully identified dependencies in the `pom.xml` and created corresponding configurations and beans.
  
  Example:
  - AOP Auto configuration match due to the presence of the `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency.
  - Creation of Dispatcher Servlet for Spring MVC since `spring-boot-starter-web` is in the classpath.

### Negative Matches

- **Negative Matches** indicate that Spring Boot did not create certain configurations or beans due to the absence of corresponding dependencies.

  Example:
  - No creation of configurations for ActiveMQ, Batch, Cache, Cassandra Database, Couchbase Database, Elasticsearch, LDAP, MongoDB, etc.

### Exclusions

- **Exclusions** list classes or configurations that are intentionally excluded from auto-configuration. Developers can specify exclusions if they want to manually handle certain configurations.

  Example:
  - Excluding `DataSourceAutoConfiguration` to handle data source configuration manually.

### Unconditional Classes

- **Unconditional Classes** represent classes and beans that are created regardless of the defined dependencies. These are essential classes for the Spring Boot application to run.

## Controlling Auto Configuration with Exclusions

You can control which configurations or beans are created automatically by specifying exclusions. For instance, if you don't want Spring Boot to auto-configure the `DataSourceAutoConfiguration` class, add the following annotation to your main application class:

```java
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})
public class EasySchoolApplication {
    // Main method and other configurations
}
```

Remember that excluding configurations is rare, and Spring Boot's default auto-configuration is often sufficient for building various web applications.

Understanding the Auto Configuration report is valuable for debugging purposes, especially when you encounter issues related to bean creation or configuration.

Feel free to explore and experiment with this feature in your Spring Boot projects. It enhances developer productivity by reducing the manual effort required for bean and configuration setup.
