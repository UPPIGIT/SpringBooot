# Web Application Development with Spring Boot: Recap

Let's summarize the key points covered in our journey of building web applications with Spring Boot:

1. **Introduction to Web Applications:**
   - Discussed the role of servlets and servlet containers in web application development.
   - Introduced Spring Boot as a time-saving framework for building web applications.

2. **Getting Started with Spring Boot:**
   - Used [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) to generate a skeleton for a Java web application.
   - Chose Maven as the build tool and included dependencies, such as `spring-boot-starter-web`, to build a basic web application.

3. **Understanding the Main Class:**
   - Identified the main class of a Spring Boot web application, typically annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`.
   - Explored the three annotations included in `@SpringBootApplication`: `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, `@ComponentScan`, and `@SpringBootConfiguration`.

4. **Creating a Custom Path with Spring MVC:**
   - Implemented a custom path (`/home`) using the `@RequestMapping` annotation.
   - Discussed how this annotation provides routing information to the Spring MVC framework.

5. **Configuring Server Port and Context Path:**
   - Explored the process of overriding default configurations related to server port and context path in the `application.properties` file.
   - Demonstrated how to change the default port (e.g., `server.port=8081`) and context path (e.g., `server.servlet.context-path=/eazyschool`).

6. **Generating Random Port Numbers:**
   - Introduced a hidden feature of Spring Boot: configuring the port number as zero (`server.port=0`) to start the web application at a random port.
   - Highlighted scenarios where this feature can be useful, such as running multiple instances for testing or in Docker containers.

7. **Auto Configuration in Spring Boot:**
   - Explored the concept of Auto Configuration in Spring Boot.
   - Enabled debug mode (`debug=true`) to generate an Auto Configuration report during application startup.
   - Analyzed the Auto Configuration report, including positive matches, negative matches, exclusions, and unconditional classes.

8. **Controlling Auto Configuration with Exclusions:**
   - Demonstrated how to control automatic bean creation and configurations by excluding specific classes from auto-configuration.
   - Emphasized that excluding configurations is rare, and Spring Boot's default auto-configuration is often sufficient.

9. **Recap and Celebration:**
   - Reviewed the key concepts, annotations, and configurations covered in the web application development journey.
   - Encouraged a break, celebration, and relaxation before continuing with the next lectures.

This recap marks a milestone in our exploration of web application development with Spring Boot. Take a well-deserved break, recharge, and get ready for the upcoming lectures.

Thank you, and I look forward to continuing the learning journey with you in the next lecture. Bye for now!
