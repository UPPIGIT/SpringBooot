# Using a Random Port in Spring Boot

In this lecture, we'll explore a lesser-known feature in Spring Boot: the ability to configure the port number as zero, indicating that the application should start on a random port. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple instances of the same application need to run simultaneously, such as during testing or in containerized environments like Docker or Kubernetes.

## Configuring a Random Port

To configure a random port in Spring Boot, modify the `application.properties` file and set the `server.port` property to zero:

```properties
# Configure the port as zero for a random port
server.port=0
```

By setting the port to zero, Spring Boot understands that it should assign a random, available port at runtime.

## Benefits of Using a Random Port

1. **Avoid Port Conflicts:** Running multiple instances of the same application on the same machine may lead to port conflicts. Configuring a random port ensures that each instance gets a unique port, preventing conflicts.

2. **Scalability:** In scenarios where you want to scale your application by running multiple instances (for testing or other purposes), a random port allows these instances to coexist without manual port assignment.

## Testing the Random Port Feature

1. Save the changes to the `application.properties` file.

2. Build the Spring Boot application.

3. Start the application using the main class (`EazySchoolApplication`). Observe that the application starts on a random port.

4. Stop the application and restart it. Note that a different random port is assigned on each restart.

This feature ensures flexibility when dealing with multiple instances of the same application, making it easy to manage ports dynamically.

## Conclusion

The ability to configure a random port in Spring Boot is a valuable feature, especially in scenarios where multiple instances need to run concurrently. Developers can leverage this feature for testing, automation, and deployment in environments with dynamic port requirements.
