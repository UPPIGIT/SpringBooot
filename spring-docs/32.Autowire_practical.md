# Practical Implementation of Autowiring Strategies

In this lecture, we'll put our theoretical understanding of autowiring strategies into practice by exploring a sample project. The project, named **Example12**, will involve multiple beans of the same data type, requiring us to use autowiring strategies effectively.

## Project Structure

1. **ProjectConfig.java:**
   ```java
   @Configuration
   public class ProjectConfig {

       @Bean
       public Vehicle vehicle1() {
           return new Vehicle("Audi");
       }

       @Primary
       @Bean
       public Vehicle vehicle3() {
           return new Vehicle("Ferrari");
       }

       @Bean
       public Vehicle vehicle2() {
           return new Vehicle("Honda");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Person.java:**
   ```java
   public class Person {

       private final Vehicle vehicle;

       @Autowired
       public Person(@Qualifier("vehicle2") Vehicle vehicle) {
           this.vehicle = vehicle;
       }

       public String getPersonInfo() {
           return "Person name: Lucy\nVehicle owned: " + vehicle.getName();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Vehicle.java:**
   ```java
   public class Vehicle {

       private final String name;

       public Vehicle(String name) {
           this.name = name;
       }

       public String getName() {
           return name;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Main.java:**
   ```java
   public class Main {

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ProjectConfig.class);

           Person person = context.getBean(Person.class);

           System.out.println(person.getPersonInfo());

           context.close();
       }
   }
   ```

## Steps and Explanations

### Step 1: Autowiring by Matching Parameter Name

In the `Person` class, the constructor parameter is named `vehicle1` to match the bean name. When executed, the output should indicate that the person owns an Audi.

### Step 2: Autowiring by Primary Bean

The `@Primary` annotation is added to the `vehicle3` bean in the `ProjectConfig` class. Now, even if the parameter name in the `Person` constructor doesn't match any bean names, Spring will autowire the primary bean. The output should indicate that the person owns a Ferrari.

### Step 3: Autowiring by Qualifier Annotation

The `@Qualifier("vehicle2")` annotation is added to the `Person` constructor, specifying that the autowiring should be done with the bean named `vehicle2`. The output should indicate that the person owns a Honda.

### Conclusion

By experimenting with these steps, we gain practical insights into how autowiring strategies work in scenarios with multiple beans of the same data type. These strategies, including by parameter name, primary bean, and qualifier annotation, provide flexibility and control over the autowiring process.

Understanding and mastering these concepts is crucial for effective Spring framework development. In the next lecture, we'll explore more advanced topics related to Spring, so stay tuned! See you in the next lecture!
