# Wiring Beans in Spring: Basic Approach

In the previous lectures, we established that creating beans for Java POJO classes is crucial in a Spring application. However, merely creating beans is not sufficient; we must also establish relationships between them. This process, known as **wiring**, ensures that the Spring IoC container understands the dependencies among different beans.

## The Basic Approach to Wiring

Let's consider a scenario where we have two beans: `Vehicle` and `Person`. The challenge is to define a relationship between them. One basic approach, although not recommended for production, involves explicitly calling methods within the `@Bean`-annotated methods.

### Example Project Setup

I've set up an example Maven project named **Example9**, and within it, I've created two POJO classes: `Vehicle` and `Person`. Both classes have constructors that print a message when a bean is created. The `Person` class also includes a `Vehicle` dependency.

Here's a snippet of the `Person` class:

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private Vehicle vehicle;

    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void setVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        this.vehicle = vehicle;
    }

    // Other methods...
}
```

### Wiring Configuration

In the configuration class (`ProjectConfig.java`), we have `@Bean`-annotated methods for creating `Vehicle` and `Person` beans. The basic wiring occurs by explicitly setting the `Vehicle` in the `Person` bean:

```java
@Configuration
public class ProjectConfig {

    @Bean
    public Vehicle vehicle() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle bean created by Spring.");
        return new Vehicle("Toyota");
    }

    @Bean
    public Person person() {
        System.out.println("Person bean created by Spring.");
        
        Person person = new Person("Lucy");
        person.setVehicle(vehicle()); // Wiring: Setting the Vehicle in Person
        
        return person;
    }
}
```

### Main Class

In the `Main.java` class, we retrieve the beans from the Spring context and print their details:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ProjectConfig.class);

        Person person = context.getBean(Person.class);
        Vehicle vehicle = context.getBean(Vehicle.class);

        System.out.println("Person name: " + person.getName());
        System.out.println("Vehicle name: " + vehicle.getName());

        System.out.println("Vehicle that person owns: " + person.getVehicle().getName());

        context.close();
    }
}
```

### Observations

- The `@Configuration` annotation on the `ProjectConfig` class indicates that this class contains bean configurations.
- In the `person()` method, the `vehicle()` method is directly called to set the `Vehicle` in the `Person` bean.
- Running this application displays the bean creation messages, but the wiring is established through explicit method calls.

### Caution

While this approach works, it is not recommended for production use. It leads to hard-coded dependencies and makes it challenging to manage changes. In the upcoming lectures, we'll explore more sophisticated ways of wiring beans.

Practice this basic approach with the provided example, and in the next lecture, we'll delve into more advanced and practical wiring techniques.
