# Understanding Autowiring Strategies in Spring

In this lecture, we'll delve into the intricate details of how autowiring works internally in Spring, particularly in scenarios where multiple beans of the same data type coexist in the Spring context. This understanding is crucial for anyone working with the Spring framework, especially in complex web application development.

## Autowiring Strategies: Dealing with Multiple Beans

In a simple scenario where there's only one bean of a particular data type, Spring can easily perform autowiring by type. However, when multiple beans of the same type are present, Spring follows a series of steps to identify the correct bean for autowiring.

### Autowiring Strategies:

1. **By Type (Default):** Spring attempts autowiring based on the class type. If there is only one bean of that type, autowiring proceeds smoothly. However, if there are multiple beans, Spring looks for a match based on the parameter name.

2. **By Primary Bean:** If the parameter name doesn't match any bean names, Spring looks for a bean marked as `@Primary`. If found, autowiring proceeds with the primary bean.

3. **By Qualifier Annotation:** If neither the parameter name nor the `@Primary` bean resolves the ambiguity, Spring looks for the `@Qualifier` annotation. The `@Qualifier` annotation specifies the bean name to be used for autowiring.

### Example Scenario:

Suppose we have three beans of type `Vehicle` named `vehicle1`, `vehicle2`, and `vehicle3`:

```java
@Configuration
public class ProjectConfig {

    @Bean
    public Vehicle vehicle1() {
        return new Vehicle("Toyota");
    }

    @Primary
    @Bean
    public Vehicle vehicle3() {
        return new Vehicle("Honda");
    }

    @Bean
    public Vehicle vehicle2() {
        return new Vehicle("Ford");
    }
}
```

Now, if we are autowiring a `Person` bean with a `Vehicle` parameter:

```java
public class Person {

    private final Vehicle vehicle;

    @Autowired
    public Person(@Qualifier("vehicle2") Vehicle vehicle) {
        this.vehicle = vehicle;
    }
}
```

In this example, `@Qualifier("vehicle2")` specifies that the `vehicle2` bean should be used for autowiring.

## Conclusion:

Understanding the intricacies of autowiring strategies is crucial for handling scenarios where multiple beans of the same type exist in the Spring context. ByType, ByPrimary, and ByQualifier are essential concepts to grasp for effective autowiring configurations.

In the next lecture, we'll practically implement and explore these autowiring strategies in a sample project. Stay tuned for hands-on experience and enhanced clarity. See you in the next lecture!
