# Assignment: Implementing a Simple Spring Application

In this assignment, we are tasked with implementing a simple Spring application that demonstrates the concepts we've covered so far, including bean creation, dependency injection, and autowiring. Let's break down the problem statement:

1. **Beans to Create:**
   - **Person Bean:** Represents an individual.
   - **Vehicle Bean:** Represents a vehicle, and the `Person` bean has a dependency on it.
   - **Vehicle Service Bean:** A service associated with the vehicle, which in turn has dependencies on speakers and tires.
   - **Speaker Implementations:** Sony and Bose.
   - **Tyres Implementations:** Bridgestone and Michelin.

2. **Dependencies:**
   - **Person depends on Vehicle.**
   - **Vehicle Service depends on Speakers and Tyres.**
   - **Autwiring for Flexibility:**
     - **Configure either Sony or Bose as the primary speaker implementation.**
     - **Configure either Bridgestone or Michelin as the primary tires implementation.**

3. **Functionality:**
   - **Person can use the vehicle for travel.**
   - **Vehicle can use the vehicle service for playing music and moving.**
   - **Vehicle service uses speakers for playing music and tires for moving.**

4. **Flexibility:**
   - **Allow easy changes in the future by configuring primary implementations.**

**Assignment Task:**
- Create the necessary Java classes for the beans mentioned above.
- Establish dependency injection between these beans.
- Use autowiring for more flexibility.
- Ensure that changes in primary implementations (speakers and tires) are easy to make.

**Tips:**
- Leverage annotations such as `@Component`, `@Autowired`, and `@Primary` where necessary.
- Utilize interfaces for the Speaker and Tires, and have multiple implementations.
- Keep the application structure simple and intuitive.

**Note:**
- Don't worry if you encounter exceptions; it's part of the learning process.
- After attempting the assignment, we'll discuss a solution in the next lecture.

Best of luck, and feel free to ask for help or clarification if needed!
