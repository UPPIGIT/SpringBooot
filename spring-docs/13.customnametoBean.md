# Custom Bean Names in Spring

In this lecture, we'll explore how to provide custom names to beans in Spring. By default, the name of a bean is derived from the name of the Java method annotated with `@Bean`. However, there might be scenarios where you want to exert more control over the bean names.

## Custom Naming with `@Bean` Annotation

Consider the following example where we create three beans (`vehicleOne`, `vehicleTwo`, and `vehicleThree`) of type `Vehicle`. This time, we don't want to use the Java method names as the bean names. Instead, we want to provide custom names.

```java
@Configuration
public class ProjectConfig {

    @Bean(name = "AudiVehicle")
    public Vehicle vehicleOne() {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
        vehicle.setName("Audi");
        return vehicle;
    }

    @Bean(value = "HondaVehicle")
    public Vehicle vehicleTwo() {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
        vehicle.setName("Honda");
        return vehicle;
    }

    @Bean("FerrariVehicle")
    public Vehicle vehicleThree() {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
        vehicle.setName("Ferrari");
        return vehicle;
    }
}
```

In this example, three different approaches are used to provide custom names to the beans:

1. Using the `name` parameter in the `@Bean` annotation.
2. Using the `value` parameter in the `@Bean` annotation.
3. Directly mentioning the custom name without any parameter.

## Fetching Beans with Custom Names

In the main class (`ExampleThree`), we fetch the beans from the Spring IOC container by their custom names and data types.

```java
public class ExampleThree {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ProjectConfig.class);

        Vehicle audiVehicle = context.getBean("AudiVehicle", Vehicle.class);
        Vehicle hondaVehicle = context.getBean("HondaVehicle", Vehicle.class);
        Vehicle ferrariVehicle = context.getBean("FerrariVehicle", Vehicle.class);

        System.out.println("First vehicle: " + audiVehicle.getName());
        System.out.println("Second vehicle: " + hondaVehicle.getName());
        System.out.println("Third vehicle: " + ferrariVehicle.getName());

        context.close();
    }
}
```

## Running the Example

When you execute this program, you'll get the expected output:

```
First vehicle: Audi
Second vehicle: Honda
Third vehicle: Ferrari
```

This demonstrates how you can use custom names for your beans in the Spring framework. Whether you choose the `name` parameter, the `value` parameter, or directly specify the name, any of these approaches is valid based on your preference and readability considerations.

Feel free to experiment with these methods in your Spring projects. Thank you, and I'll see you in the next lecture!
