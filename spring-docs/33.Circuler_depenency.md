# Understanding Circular Dependency in Spring

In this lecture, we'll delve into the concept of circular dependencies in the Spring framework. A circular dependency occurs when two or more beans are waiting for each other to be created inside the Spring context due to mutual dependencies.

Let's consider an example to better understand this scenario. Assume we have a `Person` object and a `Vehicle` object. Typically, we might have a dependency from `Person` to `Vehicle`, indicating that a `Person` owns a `Vehicle`. Now, imagine if a developer decides to introduce a dependency from `Vehicle` to `Person` as well, creating a circular relationship. This is illustrated by the `@Autowired` annotation on the `Person` field within the `Vehicle` class.

Here's an overview of the scenario:

```java
public class Person {
    private Vehicle vehicle;

    @Autowired
    public Person(Vehicle vehicle) {
        this.vehicle = vehicle;
    }
}

public class Vehicle {
    @Autowired
    private Person person;

    // Other code...
}
```

In this setup, the `Person` bean has a dependency on `Vehicle`, and `Vehicle` has a dependency on `Person`, forming a circular relationship.

### Circular Dependency Resolution

When the Spring IOC (Inversion of Control) container encounters such a circular dependency during bean creation, it becomes uncertain about which bean to create first, leading to a deadlock situation. As a result, the container throws an `UnsatisfiedDependencyException` during the application's startup.

### Solution

There is no direct solution provided by Spring for circular dependencies, as it's fundamentally a design issue. The best practice is to avoid introducing circular dependencies intentionally or unintentionally. Developers need to be mindful of the dependencies they define and ensure there are no circular references.

### Practical Demonstration

In the provided example, the intentional creation of a circular dependency is demonstrated in the `Vehicle` class. The `@Autowired` annotation is used to inject a `Person` bean into the `Vehicle` class, leading to a circular dependency. When the application is executed, an `UnsatisfiedDependencyException` is thrown.

Developers should carefully design their dependency relationships to prevent such circular dependencies. Circular dependencies can result in issues that are challenging to resolve, making it essential to maintain a clean and straightforward dependency structure.
