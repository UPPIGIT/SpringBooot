# Autowiring with @Autowired Annotation: Constructor Approach

In this lecture, we'll explore another approach to autowiring using the `@Autowired` annotation, specifically applied to the constructor of a Java class. This method offers certain advantages, such as allowing the bean to be marked as `final` once the injection is complete, enhancing security.

## Autowiring with Constructor

On the left side of the screen, you can see that the `@Autowired` annotation is now applied to the constructor of the `Person` class. This method allows for making the injected `Vehicle` object `final`, ensuring that its state cannot be changed after initialization.

```java
public class Person {

    private String name;
    private final Vehicle vehicle;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters...

    @Autowired // Optional, but recommended for readability
    public Person(Vehicle vehicle) {
        System.out.println("Person bean created by Spring.");
        this.vehicle = vehicle;
    }
}
```

## Key Points:

- **Final Field:** One of the significant advantages is the ability to make the injected field `final`, ensuring that its value cannot be changed after injection.

- **Optional @Autowired for Single Constructor:** If there's only one constructor in the class, mentioning `@Autowired` is optional (as of Spring version 4.3 and later). However, for improved readability, it is still recommended.

- **Readability:** Constructor-based autowiring enhances code readability, especially if you have multiple dependencies.

## Implementing Autowiring with Constructor

Let's implement this approach in our example Maven project named **Example11**.

### Code Changes in `Person.java`

```java
public class Person {

    private String name;
    private final Vehicle vehicle;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters...

    @Autowired // Optional, but recommended for readability
    public Person(Vehicle vehicle) {
        System.out.println("Person bean created by Spring.");
        this.vehicle = vehicle;
    }
}
```

### Main Class (`Main.java`)

No changes are required in the `Main` class, as we are obtaining and printing the beans in the same way.

### Output

Executing the program should produce output similar to the previous examples, indicating that the relationship between the `Person` and `Vehicle` beans has been successfully established.

## Advantages of Autowiring with Constructor

- **Final Fields:** Making injected fields `final` enhances security and prevents changes after initialization.

- **Readability:** Constructor-based autowiring often improves code readability, especially when there are multiple dependencies.

In the upcoming lecture, we'll delve into a more advanced topic: dealing with scenarios where there are multiple beans of the same type in the Spring context. Understanding and handling such scenarios are crucial for effective autowiring. See you in the next lecture!
