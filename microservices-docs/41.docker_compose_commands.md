In the previous lecture, we explored the commands of Docker Compose and their respective functionalities:

1. **docker-compose up**: This command is used to create and start containers defined in the Docker Compose file. It builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service. When executed, it creates containers based on the configuration defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. **docker-compose down**: This command is used to stop and remove containers created by `docker-compose up`. It stops and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by `docker-compose up`. Essentially, it cleans up all the resources created by the `up` command.
   
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

3. **docker-compose stop**: This command is used to stop running containers created by `docker-compose up` without removing them. It stops running containers without removing them, allowing you to halt container execution temporarily.
   
   ```bash
   docker-compose stop
   ```

4. **docker-compose start**: This command is used to start containers that were previously created by `docker-compose up` and stopped by `docker-compose stop`. It starts existing containers that were stopped but not removed.
   
   ```bash
   docker-compose start
   ```

Here's a summary of the scenario described in the lecture:

- Using `docker-compose up`, containers were created based on the configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
  
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

- `docker-compose down` was used to stop and remove the containers.
  
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

- If you want to stop containers without removing them, you can use `docker-compose stop`.
  
  ```bash
  docker-compose stop
  ```

- `docker-compose start` can be used to start previously stopped containers.
  
  ```bash
  docker-compose start
  ```

Re-executing `docker-compose up` after containers are stopped will not create containers from scratch but instead leverage existing containers with the same names.
