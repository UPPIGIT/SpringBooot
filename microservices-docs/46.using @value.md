In this lecture, we went through the process of updating our microservices to externalize configurations using the basic approaches provided by Spring Boot. Let's summarize the changes and provide examples of how these configurations were applied in the `accounts` microservice:

### Summary of Changes:
1. Updated Docker image generation approach to use Google Jib.
2. Defined properties in `application.yml`.
3. Read these properties using the `@Value` annotation.
4. Created a REST API endpoint to expose the build version information.

### Example: `application.yml` Configuration
```yaml
# application.yml
build:
  version: 1.0
```

### Example: Reading Properties in Java using `@Value` Annotation
```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class AccountsController {

    @Value("${build.version}")
    private String buildVersion;

    @GetMapping("/build-info")
    public ResponseEntity<String> getBuildInfo() {
        return ResponseEntity.ok(buildVersion);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- We defined a property `build.version` in the `application.yml` file.
- In the `AccountsController`, we injected this property using the `@Value` annotation.
- The `buildVersion` field is populated with the value of `build.version` during application startup.
- We exposed this information via a REST API endpoint `/api/build-info`, returning the build version when accessed.

### Conclusion:
While the `@Value` annotation approach works well for managing a few properties, it becomes cumbersome to manage numerous properties across multiple microservices. Additionally, hardcoding property keys directly in Java code is not recommended for scalability and maintainability reasons. Therefore, in the next lecture, we'll explore more advanced approaches, such as using `@ConfigurationProperties` and a centralized configuration server with Spring Cloud Config, to overcome these limitations and effectively manage configurations in microservices architecture.
