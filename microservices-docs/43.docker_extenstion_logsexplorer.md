In this lecture, let me introduce a Docker extension that may be useful for you on a day-to-day basis.

Inside your Docker desktop, you'll find an option to add extensions. There are thousands of Docker extensions available, which you can use based on your requirements. So whenever you encounter a problem while using Docker containers, Docker images, or Docker desktop, always search to see if there's an extension that can solve your problem.

By installing these extensions, you can simplify your tasks and make your life easier. One such extension is related to logs. If you search for "log," you'll find an extension called Logs Explorer, officially published by Docker. Click on the "Install" button to install this extension inside your Docker desktop.

Once installed, you'll find the Logs Explorer under your extensions. Click on it, and you'll see all the logs of your running or stopped containers. Let me demonstrate this extension. I'll run the command `docker-compose up` to start all my containers.

Now, let's navigate to the Docker desktop. Under "accounts," you'll see three different microservices running: loans microservice, cards microservice, and accounts microservice. Each microservice has its own color for easy identification. For example, all accounts microservice-related logs are highlighted in blue, loans microservice in red, and cards microservice in green.

With the Logs Explorer, you can view logs from all containers without having to navigate to each container individually. If you're looking for logs from a specific container, simply select it, and the logs will be filtered automatically. You can also filter logs based on whether the containers are running or stopped. Additionally, there's a search option, and you can filter logs based on specific log types such as standard output or standard error.

These Docker extensions, like Logs Explorer, can significantly simplify your workflow. I highly recommend installing this extension on your system. In the future, if you encounter any Docker-related issues or tasks that take up a lot of time, consider looking for extensions because someone may have already built one to address your needs.

With the help of these extensions, you can streamline your Docker operations and make your tasks more efficient. That's my recommendation here.

Thank you, and I'll catch you in the next lecture. Bye.
