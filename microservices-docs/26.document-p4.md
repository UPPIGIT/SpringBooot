# Correction of Error Response Handling

In the previous lecture, we discussed the issue of using the same error code (500) for both RuntimeExceptions and failed update/delete operations, causing confusion for clients. To address this, I've made some corrections to the error handling logic and API documentation.

## Global Exception Handling

Inside the `GlobalExceptionHandler`, I've introduced new HttpStatus codes (417) for failed update and delete operations. This ensures that specific error codes are used for different types of exceptions, improving clarity and consistency.

### Example (GlobalExceptionHandler):

```java
@ExceptionHandler(RuntimeException.class)
public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponseDto> handleRuntimeException(Exception ex) {
    ErrorResponseDto errorResponse = new ErrorResponseDto(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.value(), ex.getMessage());
    return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
}
```

### Example (Update and Delete Operations):

```java
@PutMapping("/update")
public ResponseEntity<ResponseDto> updateAccount(@RequestBody AccountDto accountDto) {
    if (updateOperationFailed) {
        ErrorResponseDto errorResponse = new ErrorResponseDto(HttpStatus.EXPECTATION_FAILED.value(), "Update operation failed. Please try again or contact the dev team.");
        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.EXPECTATION_FAILED);
    }
    // Handle successful update
}

@DeleteMapping("/delete")
public ResponseEntity<ResponseDto> deleteAccount(@RequestParam("accountId") String accountId) {
    if (deleteOperationFailed) {
        ErrorResponseDto errorResponse = new ErrorResponseDto(HttpStatus.EXPECTATION_FAILED.value(), "Delete operation failed. Please try again or contact the dev team.");
        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.EXPECTATION_FAILED);
    }
    // Handle successful deletion
}
```

## API Response Documentation

I've updated the API response documentation to reflect these changes. Each API now includes appropriate `@ApiResponse` annotations with the corresponding HttpStatus codes and descriptions. Additionally, the `ErrorResponseDto` schema is specified for RuntimeException scenarios.

### Example (API Operations):

```java
@Operation(summary = "Update Account Details REST API", description = "REST API to update account details")
@ApiResponses(value = {
    @ApiResponse(responseCode = "200", description = "Account details updated successfully"),
    @ApiResponse(responseCode = "417", description = "Update operation failed", content = @Content(schema = @Schema(implementation = ErrorResponseDto.class))),
    @ApiResponse(responseCode = "500", description = "Internal server error", content = @Content(schema = @Schema(implementation = ErrorResponseDto.class)))
})
@PutMapping("/update")
public ResponseEntity<ResponseDto> updateAccount(@RequestBody AccountDto accountDto) {
    // Method implementation
}
```

## Conclusion

With these corrections, we've improved the clarity and consistency of our error handling and API documentation. Clients can now better understand the specific errors that occur and how to handle them. It's important to ensure that our APIs provide clear and accurate information to users, reducing confusion and enhancing usability.

Thank you for your attention, and I'll see you in the next lecture.
