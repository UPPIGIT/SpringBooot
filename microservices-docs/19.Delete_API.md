# Delete Account Details API

Implemented a new REST API in the Accounts microservice to support the deletion of existing customer and account details. The API expects the mobile number as a parameter, and the deletion is based on the associated customerId.

### IAccountService

```java
public interface IAccountService {
    boolean deleteAccount(String mobileNumber);
}
```

### AccountServiceImpl

Implemented the `deleteAccount` method in `AccountServiceImpl`:

```java
@Override
@Transactional
@Modifying
public boolean deleteAccount(String mobileNumber) {
    // Fetch customer details based on mobile number
    Customer customer = customerRepository.findByMobileNumber(mobileNumber)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Customer", "Mobile Number", mobileNumber));

    // Delete records from both Customer and Accounts tables
    customerRepository.deleteById(customer.getCustomerId());
    accountRepository.deleteByCustomerId(customer.getCustomerId());

    return true;
}
```

#### Code Explanation:

- `@Transactional`: Ensures that the delete operation occurs within a transaction. If an error occurs, the transaction is rolled back, ensuring data consistency.

- `@Modifying`: Informs Spring Data JPA that this method modifies data. This annotation is required for custom delete methods.

- Fetches customer details using `findByMobileNumber` from `CustomerRepository`. Throws an exception if no customer is found.

- Deletes the customer record based on customerId using `deleteById` from `CustomerRepository`.

- Deletes account records based on customerId using a custom query (`deleteByCustomerId`) from `AccountsRepository`.

### AccountsController

Added a new method `deleteAccountDetails` to `AccountsController`:

```java
@DeleteMapping("/delete")
public ResponseEntity<ResponseDto> deleteAccountDetails(@RequestParam String mobileNumber) {
    boolean isDeleted = accountService.deleteAccount(mobileNumber);

    if (isDeleted) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.OK).body(new ResponseDto("200", "Request processed successfully."));
    } else {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                .body(new ResponseDto("500", "An error occurred. Please try again or contact the dev team."));
    }
}
```

#### Code Explanation:

- `@DeleteMapping`: Specifies that this method handles HTTP DELETE requests.

- Invokes `deleteAccount` method from the `IAccountService` and captures the boolean result.

- Returns appropriate responses based on the success or failure of the deletion operation.

### Testing

Tested the delete operation with both positive and negative scenarios.

### Note

Acknowledged the importance of `@Transactional` and `@Modifying` annotations for custom delete methods to ensure proper handling of transactions and data modification.

Next, there are plans to cover topics like proper `RuntimeException` handling, auditing metadata columns using Spring Data JPA, and documenting REST APIs.
