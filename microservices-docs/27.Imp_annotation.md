# Comprehensive Guide to Building REST APIs with Spring Boot

In our recent lecture, we explored various annotations and classes provided by Spring Boot for developing robust RESTful APIs. Let's delve deeper into each of these components:

## 1. @RestController
- **Purpose:** Marks a class as a REST controller, indicating that the response from each method should be serialized directly to the HTTP response body.
- **Usage:** Ideal for building RESTful APIs where data is returned in JSON or XML format.

## 2. @ResponseBody
- **Purpose:** Annotates methods or classes to specify that their return values should be directly written to the HTTP response body.
- **Usage:** Often combined with @Controller to indicate that the return value should not be interpreted as a view name but as the response body itself.

## 3. ResponseEntity
- **Purpose:** Represents the entire HTTP response, allowing customization of status code, headers, and body.
- **Usage:** Provides flexibility in constructing responses, enabling custom status codes, headers, and response bodies.

## 4. @ControllerAdvice
- **Purpose:** Defines global exception handling for controllers, allowing centralized handling of exceptions thrown by multiple controllers.
- **Usage:** ExceptionHandler methods within @ControllerAdvice classes handle exceptions uniformly across all controllers.

## 5. @RestControllerAdvice
- **Purpose:** Combines the functionalities of @ControllerAdvice and @ResponseBody, providing global exception handling with automatic serialization of responses to JSON.
- **Usage:** Suitable for RESTful APIs where all responses are expected to be serialized to JSON format.

## 6. RequestEntity
- **Purpose:** Represents an HTTP request, including headers and body, as a single object.
- **Usage:** Allows access to both request headers and body in controller methods, facilitating advanced request processing.

## 7. @RequestHeader
- **Purpose:** Extracts specific request header values as method parameters in controller methods.
- **Usage:** Useful for accessing and utilizing specific header information in controller logic.

## 8. @RequestBody
- **Purpose:** Binds the body of a web request to a method parameter, converting the request body into a Java object.
- **Usage:** Enables extraction and processing of request body data in controller methods, facilitating interaction with client data.

These annotations and classes form the backbone of building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot, offering powerful tools for handling requests, responses, and exceptions. Understanding their functionalities and usage patterns is essential for developing efficient and maintainable microservices.

By mastering these components, developers can create robust and scalable RESTful APIs that meet the needs of modern web applications.

Thank you for exploring this comprehensive guide, and I look forward to our continued learning journey in the next lecture!

# Comprehensive Guide to Building REST APIs with Spring Boot

In our recent lecture, we explored various annotations and classes provided by Spring Boot for developing robust RESTful APIs. Let's delve deeper into each of these components:

## 1. @RestController
- **Purpose:** Marks a class as a REST controller, indicating that the response from each method should be serialized directly to the HTTP response body.
- **Usage:** Ideal for building RESTful APIs where data is returned in JSON or XML format.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

  @RestController
  @RequestMapping("/api")
  public class ExampleController {

      @GetMapping("/hello")
      public String hello() {
          return "Hello, world!";
      }
  }
  ```

## 2. @ResponseBody
- **Purpose:** Annotates methods or classes to specify that their return values should be directly written to the HTTP response body.
- **Usage:** Often combined with @Controller to indicate that the return value should not be interpreted as a view name but as the response body itself.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

  @Controller
  public class ExampleController {

      @GetMapping("/hello")
      @ResponseBody
      public String hello() {
          return "Hello, world!";
      }
  }
  ```

## 3. ResponseEntity
- **Purpose:** Represents the entire HTTP response, allowing customization of status code, headers, and body.
- **Usage:** Provides flexibility in constructing responses, enabling custom status codes, headers, and response bodies.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  import org.springframework.http.*;
  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

  @RestController
  @RequestMapping("/api")
  public class ExampleController {

      @GetMapping("/hello")
      public ResponseEntity<String> hello() {
          HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
          headers.setContentType(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN);
          return new ResponseEntity<>("Hello, world!", headers, HttpStatus.OK);
      }
  }
  ```

## 4. @ControllerAdvice
- **Purpose:** Defines global exception handling for controllers, allowing centralized handling of exceptions thrown by multiple controllers.
- **Usage:** ExceptionHandler methods within @ControllerAdvice classes handle exceptions uniformly across all controllers.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

  @ControllerAdvice
  public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

      @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
      public ResponseEntity<String> handleException(Exception ex) {
          return new ResponseEntity<>("An error occurred: " + ex.getMessage(), HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
      }
  }
  ```

## 5. @RestControllerAdvice
- **Purpose:** Combines the functionalities of @ControllerAdvice and @ResponseBody, providing global exception handling with automatic serialization of responses to JSON.
- **Usage:** Suitable for RESTful APIs where all responses are expected to be serialized to JSON format.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

  @RestControllerAdvice
  public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

      @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
      public String handleException(Exception ex) {
          return "An error occurred: " + ex.getMessage();
      }
  }
  ```

## 6. RequestEntity
- **Purpose:** Represents an HTTP request, including headers and body, as a single object.
- **Usage:** Allows access to both request headers and body in controller methods, facilitating advanced request processing.
- **Example:** (Usage in controller method parameter)
  ```java
  import org.springframework.http.*;
  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

  @RestController
  @RequestMapping("/api")
  public class ExampleController {

      @PostMapping("/echo")
      public String echoRequest(@RequestBody String requestBody) {
          return "Received request body: " + requestBody;
      }
  }
  ```

## 7. @RequestHeader
- **Purpose:** Extracts specific request header values as method parameters in controller methods.
- **Usage:** Useful for accessing and utilizing specific header information in controller logic.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

  @RestController
  @RequestMapping("/api")
  public class ExampleController {

      @GetMapping("/user-agent")
      public String getUserAgent(@RequestHeader("User-Agent") String userAgent) {
          return "User-Agent: " + userAgent;
      }
  }
  ```

## 8. @RequestBody
- **Purpose:** Binds the body of a web request to a method parameter, converting the request body into a Java object.
- **Usage:** Enables extraction and processing of request body data in controller methods, facilitating interaction with client data.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

  @RestController
  @RequestMapping("/api")
  public class ExampleController {

      @PostMapping("/echo")
      public String echoRequestBody(@RequestBody String requestBody) {
          return "Received request body: " + requestBody;
      }
  }
  ```

These annotations and classes form the backbone of building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot, offering powerful tools for handling requests, responses, and exceptions. Understanding their functionalities and usage patterns is essential for developing efficient and maintainable microservices.

By mastering these components, developers can create robust and scalable RESTful APIs that meet the needs of modern web applications.
