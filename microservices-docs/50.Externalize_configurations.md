In this lecture, the instructor discussed different approaches to externalize configurations and activate profiles in Spring Boot applications. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Command Line Arguments:**
   - Command line arguments can be used to override properties in Spring Boot applications.
   - They have the highest precedence among all configuration sources.
   - Use the `--` prefix followed by the property key and value.
   - Example: `java -jar your-application.jar --build.version=3.0`

2. **JVM System Properties:**
   - JVM system properties can also override properties in Spring Boot applications.
   - They have lower precedence than command line arguments but higher than normal property files.
   - Use the `-D` prefix followed by the property key and value.
   - Example: `java -Dbuild.version=3.0 -jar your-application.jar`

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - Environment variables are widely supported and can be used to provide external configurations.
   - They are accessible in Java code via `System.getenv()` method.
   - Property key names should be converted to uppercase and dots replaced with underscores.
   - Example (Windows): `set BUILD_VERSION=3.0 && java -jar your-application.jar`
   - Example (Linux/Mac): `BUILD_VERSION=3.0 java -jar your-application.jar`

4. **Precedence:**
   - Command line arguments have the highest precedence, followed by JVM system properties and then environment variables.
   - If the same property is defined in multiple sources, the value from the source with higher precedence will be used.

By using these approaches, you can activate specific profiles and provide environment-specific configurations without modifying the application code or rebuilding Docker images. This adheres to the principles of the 12-factor methodology by keeping configurations externalized and easily configurable across different environments.


In this lecture, the instructor demonstrated how to activate a specific profile using externalized configuration approaches in a Spring Boot application. The three approaches covered were:

1. **Command Line Arguments:**
   - Provided the `spring.profiles.active` and `build.version` as command line arguments.
   - Executed the application with these command line arguments.

2. **JVM System Properties:**
   - Provided the `-Dspring.profiles.active` and `-Dbuild.version` as JVM system properties.
   - Executed the application with these JVM system properties.

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - Set environment variables `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` and `BUILD_VERSION`.
   - Executed the application with these environment variables.

The instructor used the IDE to modify run configurations and demonstrated the activation of different profiles based on the provided externalized configurations.

Finally, the instructor emphasized the importance of making microservices immutable and discussed the advantages of externalized configurations. However, they hinted at some disadvantages of the basic approach, which will be discussed in future lectures.

The assignment was introduced, where similar changes need to be made inside the "loans" and "cards" microservices.

In the next lecture, the instructor plans to discuss the disadvantages of the basic approach and delve deeper into the topic.

In this lecture, the instructor highlighted several limitations or drawbacks associated with externalizing configurations using Spring Boot alone:

1. **Manual Configuration Setup:**
   - Using CLI arguments, JVM properties, or environment variables requires manual setup, which can introduce potential errors during deployment.
   - Dependency on manual setup can be challenging, especially when dealing with multiple microservices and instances.

2. **Configuration Management Complexity:**
   - As the number of microservices increases, so does the complexity of managing configurations across them.
   - Versioning and auditing of configurations become essential but are not supported effectively by Spring Boot profiles alone.

3. **Security Concerns:**
   - Environment variables lack granular access control, exposing sensitive information to server admins.
   - Plain text passwords may be required for database configurations, posing security risks as encryption and secure storage are not supported.

4. **Challenges with Multiple Instances:**
   - Managing configurations for multiple instances of microservices becomes cumbersome and error-prone, especially with manual tasks.
   - Scaling to a large number of instances exacerbates the challenge.

5. **Runtime Configuration Updates:**
   - Changing property values at runtime requires application restarts, which is not ideal for dynamic environments.
   - Microservices should be able to read the latest property values without restarting.

Given these limitations, relying solely on Spring Boot for configuration management in microservices is not sufficient, especially for larger and more complex projects. The instructor emphasized the need for advanced options like Spring Cloud Config Server to overcome these challenges effectively.

In the next lecture, the instructor plans to start the journey of exploring Spring Cloud Config Server, an advanced solution for managing configurations in microservices applications.
