In this lecture, we explored the second approach for reading properties in Spring Boot microservices, which involves using environment variables. Here's a summary of the changes and examples of how this approach was applied in the `accounts` microservice:

### Summary of Changes:
1. Autowired the `Environment` interface in the `AccountsController`.
2. Created a new REST API endpoint to expose the Java version information.
3. Read the Java home environment variable using the `Environment` interface.

### Example: Reading Environment Properties in Java using `Environment` Interface
```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.core.env.Environment;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class AccountsController {

    @Autowired
    private Environment environment;

    @GetMapping("/java-version")
    public ResponseEntity<String> getJavaVersion() {
        String javaHome = environment.getProperty("JAVA_HOME");
        return ResponseEntity.ok(javaHome);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- We autowired the `Environment` interface in the `AccountsController` to access environment properties.
- Created a new REST API endpoint `/api/java-version` to expose Java version information.
- Used the `getProperty()` method of the `Environment` interface to retrieve the value of the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

### Conclusion:
The second approach allows us to access environment variables within our microservices, making it suitable for handling sensitive information like passwords or API keys. However, this approach has limitations, such as the inability to access properties defined in the application.yml file and the need to hardcode property keys in Java code.

In the next lecture, we'll explore a more advanced approach using `@ConfigurationProperties` to overcome these limitations and efficiently manage configurations in Spring Boot microservices.

Thank you, and I'll see you in the next lecture. Bye!
