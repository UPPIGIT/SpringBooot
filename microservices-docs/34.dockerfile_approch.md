Sure, here are simplified and more readable notes based on the lecture content:

**Section 4: Dockerizing Microservices**

**Workspace Setup:**
- Organized workspace into sections (e.g., Section 4).
- Copied microservice projects (accounts, cards, loans) from Section 2 to Section 4.
- Renamed Section 2 folder to Section 4.
- Deleted `.idea` folder to reset IntelliJ IDEA settings for Section 4.

**Pom.xml Adjustment:**
- Modified `pom.xml` of the Accounts Microservice.
- Set packaging to JAR (`<packaging>jar</packaging>`).
- Ensures the microservice is packaged as a JAR for Dockerization.

**Compilation and Packaging:**
- Used Maven command `mvn clean install` to compile and package the microservice.
- Maven created a "fat" JAR containing all dependencies.
- Confirmed successful compilation and packaging.

**Running the Microservice:**
- Executed microservice using Maven (`mvn spring-boot:run`) and Java (`java -jar`) commands.
- Confirmed functionality by accessing microservice endpoints (e.g., creating and fetching accounts).
- Demonstrated starting and stopping the microservice.

**Next Steps:**
- Writing a Dockerfile to define instructions for building Docker images.
- Dockerizing the Accounts Microservice using Dockerfile instructions.

These simplified notes provide a clear overview of the steps taken to prepare the Accounts Microservice for Dockerization.
