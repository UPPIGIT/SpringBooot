# Enhancing Schema Object Documentation with SpringDoc OpenAPI

In this lecture, we'll focus on enhancing the documentation related to our schema objects, such as DTO classes. By using specific annotations, we can improve the clarity and usability of our documentation.

## DTO-Level Documentation

We'll start by visiting our DTO classes and applying annotations to provide more meaningful information about the schema objects they represent. This includes specifying a name, description, and example data for each field within the DTO.

### Example (CustomerDto):

```java
@Schema(name = "Customer", description = "Schema to hold customer and account information")
public class CustomerDto {
    @Schema(description = "Name of the customer", example = "Eazy Byte")
    private String name;
    
    @Schema(description = "Email address of the customer", example = "example@email.com")
    private String email;
    
    @Schema(description = "Mobile number of the customer", example = "1234567890")
    private String mobileNumber;
    
    @Schema(description = "Accounts details of the customer")
    private List<AccountDto> accounts;
    
    // Getters and setters
}
```

## Response Object Documentation

Next, we'll enhance the documentation for our response objects, such as `ResponseDto` and `ErrorResponseDto`. Similar to DTO classes, we'll apply the `@Schema` annotation to provide details about the schema objects returned in responses.

### Example (ResponseDto):

```java
@Schema(name = "Response", description = "Schema to hold successful response information")
public class ResponseDto {
    @Schema(description = "Status code in the response", example = "200")
    private int statusCode;
    
    @Schema(description = "Status message in the response", example = "Request processed successfully")
    private String statusMessage;
    
    // Getters and setters
}
```

## Error Response Documentation

For error responses, we'll ensure that the `ErrorResponseDto` schema is properly documented. Additionally, we'll specify how this schema is used in API responses using the `@ApiResponse` annotation.

### Example (GlobalExceptionHandlerLogic):

```java
@ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponseDto> handleException(Exception ex) {
    ErrorResponseDto errorResponse = new ErrorResponseDto(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.value(), ex.getMessage());
    return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
}
```

### Example (API Operation):

```java
@Operation(summary = "Update Account Details REST API", description = "REST API to update account details")
@ApiResponses(value = {
    @ApiResponse(responseCode = "200", description = "Account details updated successfully"),
    @ApiResponse(responseCode = "500", description = "Internal server error", content = @Content(schema = @Schema(implementation = ErrorResponseDto.class)))
})
@PutMapping("/update")
public ResponseEntity<ResponseDto> updateAccount(@RequestBody AccountDto accountDto) {
    // Method implementation
}
```

## Conclusion

By applying appropriate annotations such as `@Schema`, `@ApiResponse`, and `@Content`, we can enhance the documentation of our schema objects, response objects, and error responses. This improves the overall clarity and usability of our API documentation, making it easier for consumers to understand and interact with our APIs.

With these enhancements, our microservices adhere to the industry standard of documenting REST APIs effectively.
