It seems like you've provided a detailed explanation of adding a new method `fetchAccountDetails` to the `AccountsController` to retrieve account and customer details based on a mobile number. Additionally, you've created corresponding methods in the `IAccountService` and `AccountServiceImpl` to handle the business logic.

Here's a summarized version of the provided content in Markdown format:

# Fetch Account Details by Mobile Number

In this section, we will create a REST API to fetch account and customer details based on the mobile number. The method `fetchAccountDetails` will be added to the `AccountsController`.

### AccountsController

```java
@GetMapping("/fetch")
public ResponseEntity<CustomerDto> fetchAccountDetails(@RequestParam String mobileNumber) {
    // Business logic to fetch details
    // ...
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.OK).body(customerDto);
}
```

### IAccountService

```java
public interface IAccountService {
    CustomerDto fetchAccount(String mobileNumber);
}
```

### AccountServiceImpl

```java
public class AccountServiceImpl implements IAccountService {

    // ... (existing code)

    @Override
    public CustomerDto fetchAccount(String mobileNumber) {
        // Business logic to fetch account and customer details
        // ...
        return customerDto;
    }
}
```

### Exception Handling

Create a new exception class `ResourceNotFoundException` to handle scenarios where the resource is not found.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
public class ResourceNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
    public ResourceNotFoundException(String resource, String fieldName, String fieldValue) {
        super(String.format("%s not found with %s: %s", resource, fieldName, fieldValue));
    }
}
```

Update the global exception handler to handle `ResourceNotFoundException`.

### Summary

- Added a method in `AccountsController` to fetch details by mobile number.
- Created corresponding methods in `IAccountService` and `AccountServiceImpl`.
- Implemented exception handling for resource not found scenarios.
