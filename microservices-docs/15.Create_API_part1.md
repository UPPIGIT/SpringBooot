# Building Business Logic in Accounts Microservice

## Overview

In this lecture, we'll delve into building the actual business logic inside our Accounts Microservice. The goal is to create a REST API that supports the creation of a new account and customer details in our H2 database. Pay close attention as we cover standards such as exception handling, service layer logic, and the utilization of the DTO pattern.

## Controller Configuration

Firstly, let's go to the `AccountsController` class. Remove the unnecessary `sayHello` API, and establish a common prefix for our REST APIs using the `@RequestMapping` annotation. We'll set the prefix path as `/api` for all APIs within this controller. Additionally, specify the response type as JSON using `produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE`.

Now, let's create a method to handle the account creation operation. This method, `createAccount()`, will return a `ResponseEntity` containing a `ResponseDto`. It takes a `CustomerDto` as the request payload using the `@RequestBody` annotation. The method is annotated with `@PostMapping` and has the path `/create`.

### Controller Code

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public class AccountsController {

    // Existing code...

    @PostMapping("/create")
    public ResponseEntity<ResponseDto> createAccount(@RequestBody CustomerDto customerDto) {
        // Business logic for creating a new account...
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED)
            .body(new ResponseDto(AccountsConstants.STATUS_201, AccountsConstants.MESSAGE_201));
    }
}
```

## Service Layer

Now, let's create the service layer to encapsulate the business logic. We'll define an interface `IAccountsService` and its implementation `AccountServiceImpl`. This service will have a method `createAccount()` that takes a `CustomerDto` as input.

### Service Interface

```java
public interface IAccountsService {
    void createAccount(CustomerDto customerDto);
}
```

### Service Implementation

```java
@Service
public class AccountServiceImpl implements IAccountsService {

    private final AccountRepository accountRepository;
    private final CustomerRepository customerRepository;

    public AccountServiceImpl(AccountRepository accountRepository, CustomerRepository customerRepository) {
        this.accountRepository = accountRepository;
        this.customerRepository = customerRepository;
    }

    @Override
    public void createAccount(CustomerDto customerDto) {
        // Business logic for creating a new account...
    }
}
```

## Mapper Classes

To facilitate the conversion between entities and DTOs, we'll create mapper classes (`AccountsMapper` and `CustomerMapper`). These classes will handle the mapping logic.

### AccountsMapper

```java
public class AccountsMapper {

    public static CustomerDto mapToAccountDto(Accounts accounts) {
        // Mapping logic...
    }

    public static Accounts mapToAccounts(AccountsDto accountsDto) {
        // Mapping logic...
    }
}
```

### CustomerMapper

```java
public class CustomerMapper {

    public static CustomerDto mapToCustomerDto(Customer customer) {
        // Mapping logic...
    }

    public static Customer mapToCustomer(CustomerDto customerDto) {
        // Mapping logic...
    }
}
```

## Constants

Maintain constants, such as status codes and messages, in a dedicated `AccountsConstants` class.

### Constants Class

```java
public class AccountsConstants {

    public static final String STATUS_201 = "201";
    public static final String MESSAGE_201 = "Account created successfully";

    // Other constants...
}
```

By following these steps, we lay the foundation for our business logic inside the Accounts Microservice. The use of DTOs, service layers, and mappers enhances code organization and maintainability. In the next lecture, we'll continue building on this foundation, incorporating more functionality and demonstrating the practical aspects of these components. Stay tuned!

Thank you, and see you in the next lecture!
