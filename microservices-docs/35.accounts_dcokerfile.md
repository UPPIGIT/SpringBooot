**Lecture: Writing a Dockerfile for Accounts Microservice**

**Objective:**
- To create a Dockerfile for the Accounts Microservice.
- The Dockerfile will define instructions for building a Docker image.

**Setup:**
- Stop the running instance of the Accounts Microservice by pressing Ctrl+C.
- Ensure Docker is running on your system.

**Creating Dockerfile:**
- Right-click on the Accounts Microservice folder and select "New File".
- Name the file "Dockerfile" (no file extension).
- Start by specifying the base image for the Docker image using the `FROM` command.
  - Use `openjdk:17-jdk-slim` as the base image, indicating Java 17.
  - This line tells Docker that the image depends on OpenJDK with Java 17.
- Add a `MAINTAINER` command to provide information about the maintainer of the Docker image.
  - Example: `MAINTAINER easybytes.com`
- Use the `COPY` command to copy the JAR file of the Accounts Microservice into the Docker image.
  - Specify the path of the JAR file inside the target folder.
  - Example: `COPY target/accounts-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar accounts-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
- Define the `ENTRYPOINT` command to specify the command to execute when the container starts.
  - Example: `ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "accounts-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"]`
  - This command tells Docker to execute the JAR file when the container starts.

**Comments for Clarity:**
- Add comments to improve readability and understanding of the Dockerfile.
- Comments provide context and explanations for each section of the Dockerfile.
- Example comments:
  - Information about who maintains the Docker image.
  - Explanation of adding the application JAR to the Docker image.
  - Description of the command to execute the application.

**Conclusion:**
- The Dockerfile is successfully created with instructions for building the Docker image.
- In the next lecture, we will use this Dockerfile to generate a Docker image for the Accounts Microservice.

This Dockerfile provides a clear set of instructions for Docker to build the image, ensuring that the Accounts Microservice is properly packaged and executable within a Docker container.

```Dockerfile
# Define the base image containing Java runtime
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Information about the maintainer of the Docker image
MAINTAINER easybytes.com

# Add the application JAR to the Docker image
COPY target/accounts-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar accounts-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

# Execute the application when the container starts
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "accounts-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"]
```
This Dockerfile defines instructions for building a Docker image for the Accounts Microservice:
- It specifies the base image containing Java runtime (OpenJDK 17).
- The `MAINTAINER` command provides information about the maintainer of the Docker image.
- The `COPY` command copies the JAR file of the Accounts Microservice into the Docker image.
- The `ENTRYPOINT` command specifies the command to execute when the container starts, which is running the JAR file of the Accounts Microservice using Java.

To summarize the steps outlined in the lecture:

1. **Ensure Docker Installation**: Confirm that Docker is installed and running by checking the version using `docker version`.

2. **Build Docker Image**: Run the `docker build` command to build a Docker image based on the provided Dockerfile. The command structure is:
   ```
   docker build -t <username>/accounts:S4 .
   ```
   Replace `<username>` with your Docker account username and `S4` with the desired tag/version.

3. **Verify Image Creation**: After the build process completes, verify that the Docker image is created successfully by listing all images using `docker images` and inspecting the specific image using `docker inspect <image_id>`.

4. **Additional Verification**: You can also check the Docker Desktop interface to visualize the created image and its layers.

5. **Next Steps**: Once the Docker image is generated, the next step is to create a Docker container from this image and perform testing. This will be covered in the upcoming lecture.

Ensure to replace placeholders like `<username>` and `<image_id>` with appropriate values according to your setup.

Following these steps will enable you to create a Docker image for your Accounts Microservice and prepare it for containerization.

To summarize the steps outlined in the lecture for running a Spring Boot application as a Docker container using a Dockerfile:

1. **Build the Application**: Run Maven command `mvn clean install` to generate a fat jar of your application inside the `target` folder.

2. **Create a Dockerfile**: Define a Dockerfile with instructions to build the Docker image. Include steps to copy the generated jar file into the image, set any environment variables, and specify the command to run the application.

3. **Build the Docker Image**: Run the `docker build` command, specifying the tag name for the Docker image (`<username>/accounts:S4`), to generate the Docker image based on the Dockerfile instructions.

4. **Run a Docker Container**: Use the `docker run` command to create a container from the Docker image. Specify port mappings using the `-p` flag to expose container ports to the outside world. Also, include the `-d` flag for detached mode to run the container in the background. Example command:
   ```
   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 <username>/accounts:S4
   ```

5. **Verify Container Creation**: Check the status of the running container using `docker ps` command. You can also verify container creation and configuration through Docker Desktop interface.

6. **Understanding Port Mapping**: Port mapping (or port forwarding/publishing) is used to expose container ports to the outside world. The first port number represents the port on the host system, while the second port number represents the port within the container. For example, `-p 8081:8080` maps port 8080 in the container to port 8081 on the host system.

By following these steps, you can successfully convert your Spring Boot application into a Docker container, allowing for easy deployment, scalability, and portability across different environments.
