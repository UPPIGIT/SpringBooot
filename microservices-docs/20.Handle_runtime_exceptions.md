# Handling Runtime Exceptions in GlobalExceptionHandler

In this section, we will discuss handling runtime exceptions within the GlobalExceptionHandler in the Accounts microservice. Currently, the exception handling is limited to business-specific exceptions like ResourceNotFoundException and CustomerAlreadyExistException. However, it is essential to address any runtime exceptions that may occur unexpectedly.

### GlobalExceptionHandler

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {

    // Existing exception handlers...

    // Handle runtime exceptions
    @ExceptionHandler(RuntimeException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<Object> handleRuntimeException(RuntimeException ex, WebRequest request) {
        ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse("500", "Internal Server Error", ex.getMessage());
        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
}
```

#### Code Explanation:

- `@ExceptionHandler(RuntimeException.class)`: This annotation indicates that the following method should handle exceptions of the specified type (in this case, RuntimeException).

- `handleRuntimeException`: This method is responsible for handling runtime exceptions. It creates an `ErrorResponse` object containing information about the error, such as status code, a generic error message, and the specific message from the exception.

- `new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)`: Constructs a ResponseEntity with the errorResponse and an HTTP status indicating an internal server error (500).

### ErrorResponse Class

Consider creating a simple `ErrorResponse` class to encapsulate error details:

```java
public class ErrorResponse {
    private String status;
    private String message;
    private String details;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters...
}
```

### Testing

Test the runtime exception handling by intentionally causing a runtime exception within the application and observing the response generated by the GlobalExceptionHandler.

### Note

By extending the handling capabilities to include runtime exceptions, you ensure a more comprehensive and robust error-handling mechanism for your microservice. This approach provides better insights into unexpected issues and enables more informative responses to be sent back to the client application.
