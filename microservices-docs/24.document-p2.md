# Enhancing REST API Documentation with SpringDoc OpenAPI

In this lecture, we'll further enhance our REST API documentation to provide comprehensive information to consumers. We'll focus on adding descriptions and example data at both the controller and API operation levels.

## Controller-Level Documentation

We'll start by enhancing the documentation at the controller level. This includes providing a summary and description for all APIs within the controller. We achieve this using the `@Tag` annotation.

### Example:

```java
@Tag(name = "Accounts Controller", description = "CRUD REST APIs for accounts in EasyBank")
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/accounts")
public class AccountsController {
    // Controller methods
}
```

## API Operation-Level Documentation

Next, we'll enhance the documentation for each API operation within the controller. This includes adding a summary, description, and defining response details. We use the `@Operation` and `@ApiResponse` annotations for this purpose.

### Example (Create API):

```java
@Operation(summary = "Create Account REST API", description = "REST API to create new Customer and Account inside EasyBank")
@ApiResponses(value = {
    @ApiResponse(responseCode = "201", description = "Account created successfully"),
    @ApiResponse(responseCode = "500", description = "Internal server error")
})
@PostMapping("/create")
public ResponseEntity<String> createAccount(@RequestBody AccountDto accountDto) {
    // Method implementation
}
```

## Response Details

We also specify response details, including response codes and descriptions, using the `@ApiResponse` annotation. This ensures consumers understand the possible responses from each API operation.

## Example Data

Additionally, we'll enhance schema objects by providing example data. This gives consumers a clearer understanding of the expected data format.

## Conclusion

Enhancing REST API documentation with detailed descriptions, response details, and example data improves clarity and usability for consumers. By following these practices, we ensure that developers, testers, and external stakeholders can easily understand and interact with our APIs.

In the next lecture, we'll dive deeper into customizing schema objects to provide more meaningful example data.
