To implement profiles in your Spring Boot application, follow these steps:

1. **Create Profile-specific Configuration Files**: For each environment (e.g., QA, production), create a separate configuration file with the corresponding profile name appended to `application.yml` or `application.properties`. For example:
   - `application-qa.yml`
   - `application-prod.yml`

2. **Define Environment-specific Properties**: Inside each profile-specific configuration file, define the properties specific to that environment. These properties will override the ones defined in the default `application.yml` or `application.properties`.

3. **Activate Profiles**: You can activate profiles using the `spring.profiles.active` property. This can be set in various ways:
   - In the `application.yml` or `application.properties` file.
   - As an environment variable.
   - As a command-line argument when running your application.

Here's an example of how you can set the active profile in `application.yml`:

```yaml
# application.yml

spring:
  profiles:
    active: qa # Set the active profile to 'qa'
```

Alternatively, you can set the active profile using environment variables or command-line arguments. For example, if you want to set the active profile to 'prod' using an environment variable:

```bash
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
```

Or, if you want to set it as a command-line argument:

```bash
java -jar your-application.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
```

4. **Access Environment-specific Properties**: In your application code, you can access the environment-specific properties using the `@Value` annotation or `Environment` bean, similar to how you access other properties. Spring Boot will automatically load the properties from the active profile.

With profiles, you can easily manage environment-specific configurations without the need to rebuild your application for each environment. This provides flexibility and simplifies the deployment process, especially in microservices architectures.


In this lecture, the instructor has explained how to implement Spring Boot profiles in the `accounts` microservice. Here are the key steps:

1. **Create Profile-specific Configuration Files:**
   - Create separate configuration files for each environment (e.g., QA, production). Use a naming convention like `application-{profile}.yml`.
   - For example: `application_qa.yml` and `application_prod.yml`.

2. **Define Environment-specific Properties:**
   - Identify properties that change from environment to environment (e.g., build version, account-related properties).
   - Set different values for these properties in each profile-specific configuration file.

3. **Activate Profiles:**
   - In `application.yml`, use the `spring.profiles.active` property to specify which profile to activate.
   - Alternatively, you can set the active profile using environment variables or command-line arguments.

4. **Access Environment-specific Properties:**
   - In the application code, access the environment-specific properties using the `@Value` annotation or the `Environment` bean.

5. **Spring Config Import:**
   - In `application.yml`, under `spring.config.import`, list the profile-specific YAML files to be imported.
   - Use the `on-profile` property to specify when a particular profile should be activated.

Example of `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  config:
    import:
      - application.yml
      - application_prod.yml
```

6. **Activate Profiles Dynamically:**
   - You can dynamically activate profiles during startup by setting the `spring.profiles.active` property externally.
   - This can be done in `application.yml` or via environment variables or command-line arguments.

Example of setting the active profile in `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  profiles:
    active: prod
```

Example of setting the active profile via environment variable:

```bash
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
```

Example of setting the active profile as a command-line argument:

```bash
java -jar your-application.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
```

By using profiles, you can manage environment-specific configurations without rebuilding your application for each environment. Activating different profiles allows you to control which set of properties and configurations should be loaded.
