# Introduction to Cloud Native Development Principles

In this lecture, we'll provide a brief overview of the development principles or standards essential for building effective cloud native applications.

## Introduction to 12 Factor Methodology

The **12 factor methodology** was introduced by the engineering team at Heroku Cloud Platform in 2012. These principles aim to guide developers in designing and developing cloud native applications.
- **Advantages:** Applications built following the 12 factor methodology are ready for deployment on any cloud platform, support scalability and elasticity, exhibit system portability, and enable continuous deployment and agility.

## Evolution to 15 Factor Methodology

Over time, Kevin Hoffman expanded upon the 12 factor methodology, adding three additional principles in his book "Beyond the 12 Factor App." This revised methodology, known as the **15 factor methodology**, is the latest standard for cloud native application development.

## Key Principles of 15 Factor Methodology

The 15 factor methodology outlines the principles or guidelines that developers and organizations should adhere to while building cloud native applications. These standards are based on extensive development experience and ensure the robustness and compatibility of applications.
- **Website Reference:** Developers can refer to 12factor.net for detailed explanations of the 12 factors. Each factor is elaborated with descriptions to aid understanding.
- **Updated Standard:** The 15 factor methodology builds upon the original 12 factors, accommodating current best practices and technological advancements for building resilient cloud native applications.

## Conclusion

Understanding the principles of cloud native development, whether based on the 12 factor methodology or the more recent 15 factor methodology, is crucial for building successful cloud native applications. These standards provide guidance on designing applications that are scalable, portable, and resilient in diverse cloud environments.

In the upcoming lectures, we'll delve deeper into each of these methodologies, explaining them in an easily understandable format to equip you with the knowledge necessary for building effective cloud native applications.

# Exploring the 15 Factor Methodology: Part 1

In this lecture, we'll delve into the first five principles or guidelines from the 15 factor methodology, essential for building effective cloud native applications.

## 1. One Code Base for One Application

- **Guideline:** Maintain a one-to-one correspondence between an application (or microservice) and its dedicated code base.
- **Rationale:** Each application or microservice should have its own repository to ensure clear organization and flexibility. Common code should be managed separately and may be deployed as a standalone service.

## 2. Always Think API First

- **Guideline:** Design and develop business logic primarily as REST APIs.
- **Advantages:** Promotes flexibility, enabling different teams to work on distinct APIs. Facilitates easy integration, testing, and modification behind API implementations without impacting other applications or teams.

## 3. Dependency Management

- **Guideline:** Explicitly declare all dependencies in a single manifest file (e.g., pom.xml or build.gradle) and ensure accessibility to a dependency manager.
- **Tools:** Utilize robust dependency management tools like Maven or Gradle to automate the retrieval of dependencies from a central repository. This ensures a clear and controlled dependency management process for the application.

## 4. Design, Build, Release, Run

- **Guideline:** Progress from design to production through distinct stages: design, build, release, and run.
- **Stages:**
  - **Design:** Determine required technologies, dependencies, and tools, including development and unit testing.
  - **Build:** Compile and package the code base with dependencies, creating immutable artifacts.
  - **Release:** Combine the code base with deployment configurations based on the environment, creating immutable release components.
  - **Run:** Deploy and run the application in the designated environment using specific release artifacts.

## 5. Configuration, Credentials, and Code

- **Guideline:** Maintain strict separation between code and configurations, especially elements prone to change between deployments.
- **Configuration Examples:** Database credentials, third-party API access credentials, feature flags.
- **Practice:** Store configurations separately from code, allowing independent modification without rebuilding the application for each environment. Use externalization standards to handle sensitive configurations securely.

These principles lay the foundation for building cloud native applications that are modular, scalable, and maintainable. By adhering to these guidelines, developers can ensure clear separation of concerns, efficient dependency management, and seamless deployment processes.

In the next lecture, we'll explore the remaining principles of the 15 factor methodology.

# Exploring the 15 Factor Methodology: Part 2

Continuing our exploration of the 15 factor methodology, we'll dive into the next set of principles, focusing on logging, disposability, backing services, environment parity, and administrative processes.

## 6. Logs

- **Guideline:** Applications should not write logs to local files or folders but should redirect logs to standard output.
- **Rationale:** In cloud native environments with numerous microservices, centralizing logs in a separate log aggregator tool is more efficient for debugging and monitoring. Log aggregation facilitates easy searching and analysis of logs across all microservices from a single location.

## 7. Disposability

- **Guideline:** Design applications for quick startup and graceful shutdown to support dynamic scaling and fault tolerance.
- **Practice:** Embrace the ephemeral nature of cloud environments by enabling automatic termination and replacement of unresponsive instances. Fast startup and graceful shutdown enhance system elasticity, ensuring robustness and resilience.

## 8. Backing Services

- **Guideline:** Treat external dependencies such as databases, caching systems, and message brokers as attached resources.
- **Practice:** Maintain separation between application code and configuration details of backing services. Utilize externalized configurations to switch between different services seamlessly without modifying the application code. This promotes flexibility and portability across environments.

## 9. Environment Parity

- **Guideline:** Minimize differences between various environments (e.g., development, testing, production) to ensure consistent behavior across deployments.
- **Practice:** Automate deployment processes using CI/CD pipelines to reduce the time gap between code changes and production deployment. Foster collaboration between development and operations teams (DevOps) to bridge the people gap. Standardize tools and versions across environments to address the tools gap effectively.

## 10. Administrative Processes

- **Guideline:** Treat management tasks (e.g., database migrations, batch jobs) as isolated processes, separate from the main application logic.
- **Practice:** Version control administrative process code and package it along with the application. Execute administrative tasks within the same environment as the application, ensuring consistency and reliability. Consider deploying administrative tasks as independent microservices for efficient execution and resource management.

By adhering to these principles, developers can build cloud native applications that are resilient, scalable, and maintainable. Embracing practices such as centralized logging, disposability, and environment parity enables efficient operations in dynamic cloud environments.

In the next lecture, we'll conclude our discussion by exploring the final principles of the 15 factor methodology.

# Summary of the Last Five Principles in the 15 Factor Methodology

In this lecture, we covered the final five principles or guidelines in the 15 factor methodology, which are essential for building cloud-native applications and microservices.

## 11. Port Binding

- **Guideline:** Cloud-native applications should be self-contained and expose their services through port binding.
- **Practice:** Applications should manage servers as dependencies within themselves rather than relying on external servers like Tomcat. Port binding enables applications to expose their services to the outside world, facilitating communication between microservices.

## 12. Stateless Processes

- **Guideline:** Design applications as stateless processes to achieve scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Practice:** Stateless applications ensure that instances can be easily scaled up or down without data loss. Any required data should be stored in external backing services rather than within the application instance, enabling seamless instance termination and recreation.

## 13. Concurrency

- **Guideline:** Support concurrent processing to handle multiple users and requests simultaneously.
- **Practice:** Implement concurrency within applications to distribute workloads across multiple processes or threads. Horizontal scalability is preferred over vertical scalability, allowing applications to scale efficiently by adding more instances or processes.

## 14. Telemetry

- **Guideline:** Gather telemetry data (logs, metrics, traces, etc.) to monitor and control cloud-native applications effectively.
- **Practice:** Establish observability by collecting and analyzing telemetry data from all components of the system. Telemetry data provides insights into the performance, health, and behavior of applications, enabling informed decision-making and troubleshooting.

## 15. Authentication and Authorization

- **Guideline:** Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to cloud-native applications.
- **Practice:** Enforce a zero-trust approach by verifying the identity of users (authentication) and determining their permissions (authorization) before granting access to resources. Follow security standards such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.

By adhering to these principles and practices, developers can build robust, scalable, and secure cloud-native applications that meet the requirements of modern distributed systems. These guidelines serve as a framework for designing and deploying applications in dynamic and demanding environments.

Thank you for your attention throughout this lecture series. Make sure to refer back to these principles whenever you're building or evaluating cloud-native applications or microservices.

Good luck with your future endeavors, and may you build innovative and resilient systems that drive positive change. Farewell!
