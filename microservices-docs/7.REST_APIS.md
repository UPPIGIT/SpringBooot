In this lecture, the instructor discusses the importance of building REST services when developing microservices. The key points covered include:

1. **Microservices and REST Services:** The instructor emphasizes that microservices often involve exposing business logic to other APIs or external UI applications through REST services. RESTful communication enables synchronous communication between multiple services or applications.

2. **Communication Scenarios:** The lecture outlines three common scenarios where REST services are used:
   - Communication with a backend server using REST API.
   - Communication between different backend servers or microservices using REST API.
   - Building web applications using UI frameworks (e.g., Angular, React), which communicate with the backend server through REST services.

3. **Lightweight Nature of REST:** REST services are described as lightweight compared to SOAP-based web services. They operate based on the HTTP protocol and use the lightweight data format JSON for communication.

4. **CRUD Operations and HTTP Methods:** REST services typically support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The instructor explains the HTTP methods associated with each operation:
   - POST for creating data.
   - GET for reading data.
   - PUT or PATCH for updating data.
   - DELETE for deleting data.

5. **Input Validation:** Proper input validation is emphasized as a crucial standard for REST services. Unlike UI applications that may perform validations using HTML forms, REST services should independently validate inputs to ensure data integrity and security.

6. **Exception Handling:** The importance of comprehensive exception handling is highlighted. Regardless of whether a runtime or business exception occurs, handling exceptions and providing meaningful responses to clients is crucial for better client understanding and troubleshooting.

7. **Documentation Standards:** The instructor stresses the importance of documenting REST services, especially when dealing with a large number of APIs. The use of standards like OpenAPI Specification and Swagger is recommended for documenting APIs, making it easier for clients to understand the request and response formats, validations, and supported operations.

The lecture concludes with the promise to demonstrate the implementation of REST services using the Spring Boot framework while adhering to the discussed standards. The overall emphasis is on building production-ready services within real projects by following these standards.
