The provided text appears to be a transcript of a lecture in a programming or software development course, specifically focusing on building a basic Spring Boot web application with a REST API. The lecture covers the following topics:

1. **Creating a REST API:**
   - Introduction to creating a new REST API in a Spring Boot application.
   - Creation of a new package (`com.eazybytes.accounts.controller`) for handling controllers.

2. **RestController Annotation:**
   - Explanation of the `@RestController` annotation and its role in instructing the Spring Boot framework to expose methods as REST APIs.

3. **Creating a Hello World API:**
   - Demonstration of creating a simple method (`sayHello`) within the `AccountsController` class.
   - Annotation of the method with `@GetMapping` to specify support for the HTTP GET method.
   - The method returns the string "Hello World" when the specified path ("/sayhello") is accessed.

4. **Build and Run:**
   - Instructions on enabling annotation processing for Lombok.
   - Building the application.
   - Starting the Spring Boot application in debug mode.
   - Overview of the auto-configuration capabilities of Spring Boot based on dependencies in the project.

5. **Accessing the API:**
   - Accessing the created API through a web browser (`http://localhost:8080/sayhello`).
   - Observing the "Hello World" response.

6. **Development Productivity Tools:**
   - Introduction to Spring Boot dev tools.
   - Example of how dev tools enable fast application restarts for quick development iteration.

7. **IntelliJ IDEA Configuration:**
   - Instructions for configuring IntelliJ IDEA with a dark theme and enabling annotation processing for Lombok.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Recap of the simplicity and productivity provided by the Spring Boot framework for building microservices.
   - Encouragement to explore further topics in subsequent lectures.

Certainly! Here's the Java code for the `AccountsController` class mentioned in the theory:

```java
// File: src/main/java/com/eazybytes/accounts/controller/AccountsController.java

package com.eazybytes.accounts.controller;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class AccountsController {

    @GetMapping("/sayhello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello World";
    }
}
```

This code creates a simple Spring MVC controller class with a single method, `sayHello`, annotated with `@GetMapping("/sayhello")`. This method returns the string "Hello World" when accessed via an HTTP GET request at the "/sayhello" path.
