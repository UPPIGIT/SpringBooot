In this lecture, the instructor introduces the first challenge associated with building microservices: the traditional and time-consuming process of developing, packaging, and deploying web applications using Java classes and methods. The challenge is particularly evident in larger projects or organizations that may need to build and deploy hundreds or thousands of microservices.

To overcome this challenge, the instructor suggests using the Spring Boot framework. Spring Boot is presented as the solution that streamlines the development and deployment of microservices. The key points highlighted include:

1. **Challenge:** Traditional methods of building, packaging, and deploying microservices are time-consuming and impractical for larger projects.

2. **Solution:** Spring Boot framework is introduced as the solution to address this challenge.

The instructor encourages learners to be familiar with the basics of the Spring framework before diving into the microservices course. If learners are new to Spring, the instructor recommends taking a course focused on the Spring framework to ensure a solid understanding of concepts like beans and autowiring.

The instructor briefly mentions their Udemy course on the Spring framework, emphasizing the importance of having a foundational knowledge of Spring before continuing with the microservices course. Learners are advised to enroll in a Spring course of their choice to acquire the necessary background.

The lecture concludes by expressing the intention to cover Spring Boot concepts in the upcoming lectures, providing learners with the necessary knowledge to build microservices effectively.

This lecture sets the stage for the exploration of Spring Boot as a fundamental tool for building microservices in the subsequent sessions.
