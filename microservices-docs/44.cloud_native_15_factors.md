# Differences Between Cloud Native Applications and Traditional Apps

In this section, we explore the distinctions between cloud native applications and traditional enterprise applications, highlighting key differences in behavior, dependency, capacity, development approach, and recovery mechanisms.

## Predictable Behavior

**Cloud Native Applications:** Behavior is predictable due to loosely coupled microservices, facilitating easy tracking of issues.
**Traditional Applications:** Behavior can be unpredictable, as all business logic is consolidated, making it challenging to pinpoint errors.

## Operating System Dependency

**Cloud Native Applications:** Abstract the operating system, leveraging Docker containers for portability across different environments.
**Traditional Applications:** Dependent on the underlying operating system, limiting portability and compatibility.

## Capacity and Independence

**Cloud Native Applications:** Right-sized and operate independently, thanks to microservices architecture.
**Traditional Applications:** Often oversized and interdependent, leading to inefficient resource allocation.

## Development Approach

**Cloud Native Applications:** Support continuous delivery and Agile development methodologies through DevOps practices.
**Traditional Applications:** Tend to follow waterfall development, lacking flexibility and adaptability.

## Recovery and Scalability

**Cloud Native Applications:** Support rapid recovery and automated scalability, with platforms like Kubernetes handling instance failures and scaling based on traffic.
**Traditional Applications:** Recovery is slower and lacks automation, as they do not leverage containerization and orchestration platforms.

## Conclusion

Cloud native applications offer numerous advantages over traditional enterprise applications, including predictability, independence from the underlying operating system, efficient resource utilization, support for Agile development, and automated recovery and scalability. Understanding these differences underscores the importance of adopting cloud native principles and methodologies for building modern, resilient software solutions.

In the next lecture, we'll delve into the principles and guidelines for building cloud native applications and microservices effectively.
