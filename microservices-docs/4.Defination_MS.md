In this lecture, the instructor provides a formal definition of microservices for easy reference when explaining the concept to non-technical individuals. The definition is attributed to James Lewis and Martin Fowler:

**Microservices Definition:**
*"Microservices is an approach to develop a single application as a suite of small services."*

The key characteristics highlighted in the definition include:

1. **Independence:** Each service operates in its own process.
2. **Communication:** Services communicate through lightweight mechanisms, such as REST.
3. **Business Focus:** Microservices are built around specific business capabilities or domains.
4. **Deployability:** Services are independently deployable with fully automated deployment processes.

The definition emphasizes the modular nature of microservices, allowing them to function independently while collectively forming a cohesive application. The automated deployment aspect is crucial for achieving agility and rapid development cycles.

The instructor encourages using this concise definition when discussing microservices with non-technical stakeholders, providing a straightforward explanation of the fundamental concepts. This approach facilitates effective communication between technical and non-technical individuals.

This lecture reinforces the core principles of microservices and sets the stage for deeper exploration of the topic in subsequent sessions.
