Certainly! Here are explanations and examples for the additional Docker run commands mentioned:

### 1. Running a Specific Version of an Image:
   - Use the `:<version>` tag to specify a particular version of an image.
   - Example: Run Redis version 4.0.
     ```bash
     docker run redis:4.0
     ```

### 2. Interactive Mode and Pseudo Terminal:
   - `-i` enables interactive mode, allowing you to input commands.
   - `-t` allocates a pseudo-terminal for the container.
   - Example: Run an interactive terminal for a prompt application.
     ```bash
     docker run -it mypromptapp
     ```

### 3. Port Mapping:
   - Use `-p` to map a container's port to a host port.
   - Example: Map host port 80 to container port 5000.
     ```bash
     docker run -p 80:5000 mywebapp
     ```

### 4. Persisting Data with Volumes:
   - Use `-v` to mount a host directory to a container directory for data persistence.
   - Example: Map host directory `/opt/data` to container directory `/var/lib/mysql`.
     ```bash
     docker run -v /opt/data:/var/lib/mysql mysql
     ```

### 5. Docker Inspect:
   - Retrieve detailed information about a container using `docker inspect`.
   - Example: Inspect details of a container with ID `abcdef123`.
     ```bash
     docker inspect abcdef123
     ```

### 6. Viewing Container Logs:
   - Use `docker logs` to view logs of a detached container.
   - Example: View logs of a container with ID `xyz789`.
     ```bash
     docker logs xyz789
     ```

These commands provide additional functionalities for running containers, managing ports, persisting data, and inspecting container details. Practice using them in different scenarios to become more comfortable with Docker commands.


### Article on Jenkins Image
This is an update for the Jenkins image.
In our upcoming demo video, I used a jenkins image which is now deprecated. Instead of that, we have to use jenkins/jenkins.

In the demo video, I used the command:-

docker run jenkins

But as of now, we have to use the following command:-

docker run jenkins/jenkins
