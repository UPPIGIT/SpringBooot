# Installing and Getting Started with Docker - Quick Guide

In this guide, we'll walk through the process of installing Docker and running a simple container to ensure everything works as expected. This guide assumes you have a supported operating system (Linux, Mac, or Windows).

## Install Docker on Ubuntu

1. Visit [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and click on "Get Docker."

2. On the Docker Engine Community Edition page, choose your system type (Linux, Mac, Windows) and your OS flavor. In this example, we use Ubuntu.

3. Follow the instructions provided. For Ubuntu, ensure your system is 64-bit and running a supported version (e.g., cosmic, bionic, xenial).

4. Open a terminal and execute the following commands to install Docker using the convenience script:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
    sudo sh get-docker.sh
    ```

5. After the installation is complete, verify Docker by running:

    ```bash
    sudo docker version
    ```

## Run a Simple Container

1. Visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) to explore available images. For this example, let's search for the "whalesay" image.

2. Copy the `docker run` command provided on the Whalesay Docker Hub page. It should look like:

    ```bash
    sudo docker run docker/whalesay cowsay Hello world
    ```

3. Run the modified command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    sudo docker run docker/whalesay cowsay Hello world
    ```

4. Docker will pull the "whalesay" image from Docker Hub and run the container. You'll see a whale saying "Hello world."

Congratulations! You've successfully installed Docker and run a container. Feel free to explore more Docker features and try different images. Remember, if you're following along with the course labs, you'll have access to hands-on exercises without needing to set up Docker on your local machine.
