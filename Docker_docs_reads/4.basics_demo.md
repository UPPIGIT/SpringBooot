     ```

### 18. **`docker exec` (interactive shell):**
   - Opens an interactive shell inside a running container.
   - Example: Access an interactive shell in a running container with ID `xyz456`.

     ```

### 19. **`docker-compose up`:**
   - Starts services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file.
